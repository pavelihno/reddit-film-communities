It stars Brendan Fraser, Takehiro Hira, Mari Yamamoto, Shannon Mahina Gorman, and Akira Emoto. 

It had its premiere at TIFF in September and will be released in theaters nationwide this Friday via Searchlight Pictures. 

**Synopsis**:

Struggling to find purpose, an American actor lands an unusual gig with a Japanese agency to play stand-in roles for strangers. As he immerses himself in his clients' worlds, he begins to form genuine bonds that blur the lines between performance and reality. Confronting the moral complexities of his work, he soon rediscovers purpose, belonging, and the quiet beauty of human connection.

>Thirteen American colonies unite in rebellion, win an eight-year war to secure their independence, and establish a new form of government that would inspire democratic movements at home and around the globe. What begins as a political clash between colonists and the British government grows into a bloody struggle that will engage more than two dozen nations and forever change the world.

**Sarah's Bio:**

Sarah Botstein has produced some of the most popular and acclaimed documentaries on PBS. She is currently producing and co-directing The American Revolution along with Ken Burns and David Schmidt. Her previous work includes Jazz, The War, Prohibition, The Vietnam War, College Behind Bars, and Hemingway. The U.S. and the Holocaust marked Botstein's debut as a co-director. Botstein works closely with PBS LearningMedia to develop educational materials as part of the Ken Burns Classroom, and she was an original contributor to Ken Burns's UNUM. In addition to The American Revolution, Botstein is working on a three-part series about Lyndon B. Johnson and the Great Society.

**David's Bio:**

David Schmidt is the producer and co-director, along with Ken Burns and Sarah Botstein, of The American Revolution, a six-part, 12-hour series premiering on PBS in the fall of 2025. Schmidt began working with Florentine Films as a researcher and apprentice editor for The Roosevelts (2014), while also supervising the documentary’s seven-episode script. His research on The Vietnam War (2017) won him the Jane Mercer Footage Researcher of the Year award, and he also worked closely on that project with writer Geoffrey C. Ward and helped coordinate postproduction. With Burns, Schmidt also produced the two-part biography Benjamin Franklin (2022) for PBS. A graduate of Dartmouth College with a degree in history, Schmidt grew up on the Virginia Peninsula within the Historic Triangle of Jamestown, Williamsburg, and Yorktown—each site only minutes from his childhood home. He spent his summers working in the living history museum in Colonial Williamsburg and on the archaeological dig at Historic Jamestown. Those childhood experiences led him to pursue a career telling American history.

In Wallace and Gromet there's a scene where they're in the church talking about the ware rabbit and suspenseful organ music starts playing and we assume is the score, until the vicar turns and says ""stop playing that music"". The camera then pans to a woman on the organ who says ""sorry""

We've been doing data dumps here in Reddit from our app. This will be our third one. Just sharing the love. We'll be moving the data insights over to a newsletter and substack soon, but in the meantime I hope some of this info is of interest or even helpful! It's not also the full picture as there are obviously tons of deals that happened and didn't go to the trades. We're also still processing data coming out of AFM, but it's a start!

**\[7-Day Intelligence Snapshot from ScriptMatch AI\]**

The American Film Market (AFM) just wrapped in Los Angeles (Nov 11-16), and our AI analyzed **297 active buyer trends** from 176 unique companies the last week. Here's what's actually selling in Hollywood right now—and what it means for screenwriters.

# 🔥 The #1 Trend: Horror Is EATING Everything

If you're not writing horror, you might want to take a stab at it. Horror is hot right now.

**What we tracked:**

* **Cineverse** (Terrifier franchise) acquiring horror for Screambox platform
* **TrustNordisk** calling Norwegian vampire film their ""most anticipated project""
* **Black Mandala** handling 100+ horror titles with Cannes/Berlin/AFM presence
* **Alliance Media Partners** launching survival horror with global appeal
* **Bleiberg Entertainment** selling witch-themed home invasion thriller

**Why this matters:** The Terrifier franchise's explosive success has convinced buyers that **elevated horror** with modest budgets can dominate both theatrical and streaming. Multiple buyers cited Terrifier's ROI as the reason they're aggressively acquiring horror.

**Actionable insight:** Horror-thrillers with **high-concept hooks** (""Scream meets Black Swan"" - actual AFM pitch) are getting packaged immediately.

# 💰 Follow the Money: Who's Buying What

# Big Budget Action (Still Selling)

* **Lionsgate:** Mel Gibson's *The Resurrection of the Christ* \- ""biggest-budget AFM project,"" buyers writing huge checks despite controversy
* **20th Century Studios:** James Cameron exec producing *Painter*, an original action IP from stunt specialist Garrett Warren
* **Black Bear:** Jason Statham + David Ayer + Sylvester Stallone script = instant international sales

**Translation:** Star-driven action with **proven talent** still commands premium prices.

# Streaming Plays

* **Cineverse** leveraging Screambox horror platform for acquisitions
* **Paramount+** renewed *First Shift* after 20 weeks in Top 10
* **Netflix** released *The Trip* (Norwegian thriller)

**Translation:** Buyers want **platform-ready content** with built-in genre audiences.

# 📊 The Data: What Genres Are ACTUALLY Moving

From our last 7 days of tracking:

|Genre|Active Buyers|Market Activity Score|Deal Velocity|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||
|**Horror/Thriller**|12+ companies|28/100 (High)|Multiple deals/week|
|**Action**|8+ companies|28/100 (High)|Star-driven packages|
|**Drama (Historical)**|6+ companies|3-28/100 (Variable)|Festival-dependent|
|**Animation/Family**|3+ companies|3/100 (Moderate)|Long development|

**Reality check:** ""Market Activity Score of 28"" means these companies closed deals in the last 30 days. Scores of 3 mean they're **looking but not buying yet**.

# 🎯 What's Working: Actual AFM Pitches That Sold

Here are **real loglines** from projects that got picked up last week:

1. **""Scream meets Black Swan""** \- K-pop thriller *Perfect Girl* (Upgrade handling international)
2. **""A Quiet Place meets Another Round""** \- Horror-comedy *Buzzkill* with Billy Magnussen
3. **""Hospital siege thriller with martial arts""** \- *MRI* starring Iko Uwais (K5 International)
4. **""Snuff film thriller""** \- *Hollywood Hells* (Black Mandala)

**Pattern recognition:** High-concept mashups + established comps = instant buyer interest.

# 🚨 The Uncomfortable Truth About ""Access""

Our data tracks **access levels** for each buyer. Here's what we found:

* **Direct submissions:** 0% of AFM deals came from unsolicited scripts
* **Agent/manager packages:** 60%+ of deals had talent attached BEFORE AFM
* **Sales agent relationships:** 40%+ came through established international sales companies

**What this means:** You need **representation OR a packaged project** to access AFM buyers. Cold queries to these companies during market season = ignored.

# 💡 Actionable Takeaways for Screenwriters

# If You're Writing Horror:

✅ Study the **Terrifier franchise model** \- micro-budget, theatrical release, massive ROI  
✅ Focus on **elevated horror** with social commentary (buyers specifically mentioned this)  
✅ Target companies: Cineverse, Black Mandala, TrustNordisk, Alliance Media Partners

# If You're Writing Action:

✅ Think **international appeal** \- AFM is a global market  
✅ Consider **stunt/martial arts integration** (multiple buyers seeking this)  
✅ Attach **producer-friendly talent** before pitching

# If You're Writing Drama:

⚠️ **Reality check:** Historical dramas need **festival pedigree** or **major talent** attached  
⚠️ Development timelines are 2-3x longer than genre  
✅ Target: Film4, BFI co-productions, European art house buyers

# 🔮 What's Coming Next: Q1 2026 Production Starts

Based on AFM announcements, these projects are **greenlit and shooting in Q1 2026:**

* *Levon's Trade* \- Jason Statham/David Ayer (March 2026, London)
* *MRI* \- Iko Uwais hospital thriller (Early 2026, Jakarta)
* *The Heretiks* \- Witch home invasion (Q1 2026, Atlanta)
* *Buzzkill* \- Horror-comedy (Early 2026, Texas)

**Why this matters:** These genres and budgets are what **closed financing** at AFM. If you're writing something similar, timing is NOW.

# 📈 The Bigger Picture: Market Intelligence

AFM 2025 had:

* **260+ exhibitors** from 70+ countries
* **New AI/Innovation Hub** (Cannes partnership)
* **Horror dominance** across panels and sales

**What we're seeing:** The market is consolidating around **high-ROI genre content** (horror, action) while prestige drama requires **festival validation** before buyers commit.

As an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, she'll need to reunite with Glinda to transform herself, and all of Oz, for good.*

Director: John M. Chu

Cast: Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande, , Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Marissa Bode, Jeff Goldblum, Michelle Yeoh, Colman Domingo, Peter Dinklage, Bowen Yang

**Rotten Tomatoes:** [72%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wicked_for_good)

**Metacritic:** [61 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/wicked-for-good/)

Some Reviews:

[Next Best Picture - Lauren LaMagna](https://nextbestpicture.com/wicked-for-good/) \- 7 / 10

>The cast, led by the phenomenal Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, still deliver fantastic work that is supported by excellent crafts from all departments of production. But the source material is inherently weaker than the first, making this a less fulfilling entry as a standalone, even if it compliments Part One as a whole. The additional scenes are not necessary and only exist for the material to be long enough to qualify its own feature film, which also results in pacing issues.

[BBC - Caryn James](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20251118-wicked-for-good-review) \- 4 / 5

>Let's be clear: the Wicked films are the definition of preaching to the choir. They aren't likely to win over anyone sceptical of candy-coloured spectacle and overt sentimentality presented in Broadway show-stopping fashion. Wicked is what it is. But if you're fine with that, this latest instalment is more captivating than the last and enjoyable to watch throughout.

[DEADLINE - Pete Hammond](https://deadline.com/2025/11/wicked-for-good-review-jon-chus-part-2-musical-adaptation-1236620980/)

>What can we say about the performances that hasn’t already been said? Both Erivo and Grande could not be better, and in fact Grande really gets a chance to shine here and runs away with the picture whenever she is on screen. Erivo’s Elphaba remains the juiciest role and she defines it with the mortality only movies can bring. Bailey is terrific again, and Goldblum’s Wizard really comes into deep focus now and he’s got it going on. Marissa Bode’s wheelchair-bound Nessarose is given some key screen time and delivers in a piece of casting that is as inspiring as the character she plays. Nathan Crowley outdoes his Oscar winning production design this time around, as does Paul Tazewell’s Oscared Costumes. The visual effects are first rate. So is this whole splendidly realized and cinematic musical adaptation which if you add up the running times of both films comes in just two minutes shy of 5(!) hours. To be honest I wanted *more.*

[The Telegraph - Robbie Collin](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2025/11/18/wicked-for-good-review-second-part-fails-to-take-flight/) \- 1 / 5

>Ariana Grande is painfully wooden in Wicked’s irritating sequel. What makes it so frustrating is that director Jon M Chu is an established musicals master; his In the Heights is a modern classic of the form. But the corporate stretch-it-out-and-wring-it-dry approach here has been deadening. Even the staunchest defenders of Wicked, the stage musical about the tragic origins of The Wizard of Oz’s Witch of the West, would have to concede that it peaks just before the interval...

[Slant Magazine - Dan Rubins](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/wicked-for-good-review-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-jonathan-bailey/) \- 2.5 / 5

>But for as sharp as it may sometimes be, *For Good* is stretched out, breathless, and never really emotionally affecting, even on the level of nostalgia. (However bloated, the first film, to quote one of Glinda’s malapropisms, is thrillifying.) It may transport audiences, especially younger ones, to the colorful Oz for the bulk of an afternoon, but it also serves as a reminder that only in its tauter, wrenching stage form can *Wicked*, like a handprint on your heart, really leave you changed for good.

[Loud and Clear - Joseph Tomastik](https://loudandclearreviews.com/wicked-for-good-film-review/)

>*Wicked: For Good* takes many huge swings but misses in baffling fashion, making for a technically impressive but disappointing conclusion to the *Wicked* story. By all accounts, this is the much more difficult half of the story to pull off, as it’s where the musical in particular gets much denser and incorporates many more direct elements from *The Wizard of Oz*. Unfortunately, that difficulty rears its ugly head in *Wicked: For Good*. As ambitious as this movie is for tackling already-unwieldy source material, those ambitions ultimately don’t pay off.

[RogerEbert - Christy Lemire](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/wicked-2-for-good-film-review-2025) \- 3 / 4

>If it sounds like this second half is darker than the first, it is, but it’s also more effective in its consistency of tone. “Wicked” was all fun and games until it wasn’t, and that sudden shift was jarring. In “For Good,” we know from the start that we’re in more serious territory with the deep strings of John Powell’s score as Ozian workers build the Yellow Brick Road. Erivo and Grande find just the right amount of tenderness and sadness with “For Good,” and that bond between them shines bright once more. Poignant and intimate, it’s a legitimate tearjerker. Bring tissues.

>Despite stellar work from Erivo and Grande, *Wicked: For Good* can’t justify its existence as its own separate outing. Even with a pair of new songs and a deeper exploration of some of the musical’s beloved characters, the runtime feels bloated and bogged down by Chu’s constant attempts to make this a movie of the moment and to remind audiences of the connection they had to the first film. Simply put, Chu does not add enough new material to make this film feel like much more than a studio cash grab. There’s certainly still magic to be found in the movie for those who are seeking it, but when the credits finally roll, it’s difficult to say that Chu’s additions to this film have changed the world of *Wicked* for the better.

>It’s tangled and a bit bewildering; but then so is the original film, in which we never know whether to believe in the Wizard’s final benediction. But what a performance from Erivo; it is genuinely moving when the Prince has to convince Elphaba what we, the audience, have always known: that she is beautiful.

[FilmHounds - Paul Klein](https://filmhounds.co.uk/2025/11/wicked-for-good-film-review/)

>Erivo, Grande and Bailey are all fantastic once again, and allowed to deepen the characters more and show the complexities of them, while also remaining true to why people love them so much. It's a shame that the rest of the cast are given short shrift. Ethan Slater and Marissa Bode have the rumblings of a more interesting subplot that doesn't really go anywhere as much as it should. Even so, and despite its more frantic nature, *Wicked: For Good* continues to lovingly taking a look at what it means to be a rebel against dictatorships, how people will lie to you to get what they want, and how you must remain true to yourself at all times. It's not so much that the film is disappointing, that would be too harsh a criticism. It's that the film is merely as good as it could be, given what the stage show offers. It wraps things up, but there's no feeling of cohesion – something that was never going to be in Chu's hands, and for what he has, he excels at.

I recently saw a video on TikTok where poster was speculating what may have happened to Corporal Upham and Private Reiben (the two lone survivors of Captain Miller’s squad that was tasked to go find Private Ryan) after the events of the movie. Some people in the comments guessed that they were (or at least possibly were) KIA at some point later in the war given that the war in Europe lasted for about another year after D-Day.

These takes from the ppl in the comments confused me because I was always under the impression that if Miller’s squad found Ryan and got him home alive, that they would essentially be relieved of their duties or somehow honorably discharged and also be allowed to go home. 

It’s two monologues in particular that gave me this impression (I’ll link the exact parts). Although I don’t think it’s ever explicitly said that this is the deal, I always kind of assumed that maybe it was mentioned off-screen. I suppose it would be an unusual arrangement to make with Miller and his soldiers, but their assignment in general was obviously unusual so that just made sense to me. 

Let me know y’all think tho

If I buy a digital license to a movie, will I have access to it on all languages it is? This may sound stupid, but I don't wanna risk wanting a movie or a show in a single language. If any site only sells them in a single language and/or without subtitles please tell me to avoid it.

2. How likely is it for me to lose access to a movie because of licensing crap? I don't watch them very often nor care about watching new ones that much, so if I want to rewatch the same movie 2 years later I want to know it will stay in my account without being told that I got my license removed because of shit that shouldn't be any of my business, if it is realistically possible for me to lose them then I will just pirate them. 

Right now the only options I know I have are amazon prime and youtube, making this post I learned that both the microsoft store and google play no longer sell movies, and the microsoft one makes me a bit sad because they were the only ones who sold actual shows, not only movies, but not that much sad since I know they had almost everything only in english (english store: +3000 options, spanish store: 20, maybe less, I could only buy season 3 and 5 of spongebob in spanish, wtf?)

1p1e34w,A Thread About The Many Versions of Dangerous Liaisons,faoewiay,Business_Coffee_9421,movies,5,0.62,4,1763573680.0,2025-11-19 18:34:40,True,"Being both an avid reader and an avid film fan, I remember when my obsession with both mediums was blooming. I was so intrigued by the fact that this old French novel had nearly TEN adaptations (at that time). But what’s also pretty cool is they aren’t all the same: they have different settings, both in time and place. To me, this proves the themes are universal and timeless, not bound by era or culture

We start with the scandalous 1959 film. I’m due for a rewatch of this and I’ll update after. But it was a contemporary adaptation at the time.

Next we actually have two films that released closely to each other and both kept the setting of the original novel. 1988’s Dangerous Liaisons was a film I’d seen before I had any idea about the original novel and all the adaptation. Great movie and most would call it the best of the bunch.

But don’t sleep on 1989’s Valmont either. Annete Benning makes a great Merteuili, Meg Tilly a charming Madame de Tourvel. It’s a more playful version of the more cerebral Stephen Frears film

As a teenager in the late 90’s I of course crossed paths with Cruel Intentions. Overall it’s one of the weakest films but at least it has a unique setting in contemporary New York. The most memorable part of the film to me is the ending, as Bittersweet Symphony plays out the action. And Sarah Michelle Gellar was a huge crush of mine.

2003 again gave us a pair of adaptations. Untold Scandal moved the story to 18th century Korea and is a respectable adaptation. I’ve seen it several times and enjoy it quite a bit. Not my favorite Tourvel but a good charming Valmont (not that he’s named that)

Also in 2003, a miniseries I just finished rewatching, which seems utterly forgotten about today, a 2-part tv film set in 1960’s Paris. This is underrated. It’s long winded yes, but the sets, colors, visuals, and overall production value is stunning. It’s a really gorgeous looking film. It’s also the oldest Madame de Merteuil of all of them. It’s a slow burn but a good one, and is probably my third favorite after the 1988 and 1989 films.

Dangerous Liaisons from 2012 again changes the setting and the era, this time to Shanghai in the 1930’s. A beautiful looking film, rife with golds and yellows throughout, it has a very sexy Cecilia Chung and an appropriately seductive and charming Jang Dong-gun, it’s another good adaptation of the classic novel.

If I haven’t mentioned another version it’s cause I haven’t seen it yet. But I just had to share my love of this timeless story and the many entertaining films that came from it. Please chime in with your own thoughts and opinions on these movies.",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p1e34w/a_thread_about_the_many_versions_of_dangerous/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p1e34w/a_thread_about_the_many_versions_of_dangerous/,Discussion,False,False,False,False,2025-11-19,18,Wednesday

The audience was in total silence for the movie. It was surreal.

1p0ggda,Pan's Labyrinth is one of the most beautiful films I've watched,a7airb5f,-greek_user_06-,movies,79,0.89,8,1763483275.0,2025-11-18 17:27:55,True,"I think that Guillermo del Toro will become one of my most favourite producers. He captivated me with ""The Shape of Water"" and he did it again with Pan's Labyrinth. 

What more can I say about this beautiful film? Everything is phenomenal. The production, the casting, the colors, the practical effects, the music. This is a dark, fairytale full of magic, love and cruelty. It depicts the ugliness of our real world while establishing a mystical universe which is dark and mischievous. 

Ofelia touched my heart. Her love towards her mother and brother was pure and real. Ivana Baquero did a fantastic job. Her expressions were so spot-on and she captured Ofelia's emotions in a raw way. The rest of the characters were just as remarkable, I loved Faun's mysterious personality and the actor's gestures and body language really brought life to the character (not to mention the amazing makeup and prosthetics). Mercedes was another character whom I felt a strong connection with and as for Captain Vidal, I hated him with a deep passion. Kudos to Sergi López for making me dislike his character so much. 

The depiction of siblings' love really touched me. As someone with a younger sister, I could relate with Ofelia and Mercedes' love towards their brothers. They would give everything to keep them safe no matter what. 

The film really liked to remind us that our world is full of cruel, sadistic people like Vidal. Unfortunately for us, real life is not a fairytale. Sometimes we have to sacrifice many things to achieve a modest life. Ofelia's mother had to endure a wedding which didn't make her truly happy but by doing so, she thought that she would secure a better life for her and her children. Although the fantasy creatures in the movie were mysterious and creepy at times, it was the real people of the movie that gave me the chills. The scene with the farmer and his son made me wince and scream in anger. It is painful to remember that people like Vidal exist, people who find pleasure in causing pain to others and who will not hesitate to do despicable things without blinking an eye. 

But despite the sad tone, there was also a bright side. With hatred there is also love, with despair, hope. Ofelia, Mercedes and Dr. Ferreiro reminded me that people are capable of good things too. These characters showed selflessness and kindness and these actions had a big impact on the film. 

The ending made me a sobbing mess. Emotional yet beautiful. I loved the way it connected with the beginning of the film and how bittersweet it feels. The whole movie in general has a special place in my heart and it has become one of my most favorite movies of the year. I will definitely rewatch it but not too soon. For now, Ofelia and her story have left traces on my heart.

The Blackout: Invasion Earth is no different, but at least it's watchable. One thing I did notice was around the 50 minute mark, post editing forgot to remove the traffic within the ""exclusion zone"" so there's a scene where the futuristic helicopters are spinning up on the rooftops with a lone white car diving down the road like nothings going on. It just reminds me all films are just people trying to tell a story while the world around them continues to live like they don't exist.

It was either Spanish or Portuguese animated film. The main protagonist is this girl who is described to be the purest. She suddenly appears into this small town. No one knows where she came from and the girl lives in this abandoned park outskirts of the town. She can enter this another dimension where this grandpa who can control time/dimensions (forgot exactly what it was) lives. She also has power to look into other people’s mind. This is how she defeats the antagonists. 

The main antagonist of the movie is this organization who persuades people into buying and invest time to them. They are looking for the girl so that they can exploit her power and rule over the dimension and power the grandpa has. They come to the town the girl currently resides and starts gaslighting townspeople that they are wasting time and invest their time into their company. Soon the whole town falls into the organization’s scheme. 

This is all I remember about the movie. It has been over a decade and really loved it because the whole theme was about time.

One thing that I'm still hung up on. When Pesci/Ruffalino says ""It's what it is"" to De Niro/Sheeran about Pacino/Hoffa, does that mean:

1. This is his final warning. He knocks off everything that he's doing, stops trying to get back in as Teamsters president, etc. or we're going to kill him.

OR

2. That's it. We're putting out an active hit on him. There's nothing he can do or say at this point to stop it.

I lean towards #1, because otherwise why would Ruffalino ask Sheeran to inform Hoffa? But then, later on, when Ruffalino and Sheeran are sitting in the diner, and Sheeran is informed that he's doing the actual hit, Ruffalino says the same thing.

So may ""It's what it is"" can mean 1 or 2, depending on context?

However, I can only concentrate on one aspect at once, which leads to me watching movies or shows multiple times in order to catch everything.

The second watch I will focus more on the text since I've already experienced the visuals. 

Anyway, my guilty source of joy is when subtitles don't match the scene. If they show up before someone starts speaking, I can read it quickly and then enjoy the expressions, characters and costumes, everything. My brain fills in the words I already read and I feel like I get to experience the whole feeling/vibe of the movie at the same time. 

I'm sure it's out there somewhere, but I'm not sure where or how to search.

I think the kids of today will reminisce about the films being made today, right? The qualities of cinematography, lighting, set design etc will genuinely be nostalgic to these kids. People say everything looks unreal, fake and 'Netflix' films (theyre still wildly popular and watched) being quite common discussions about todays films. But for them its just what films have always looked like in their world.

When Star Wars came out, older cinephiles complained that cinema was becoming childish spectacle.  
When The Matrix came out, people said CGI was ruining film.  
When Tarantino and Fincher emerged, older directors said the new style was too slick and soulless.

But cinemas being made today is a reflection of our day and age, for better or for worse.

For the ones I have managed to list, I put them into a random wheel generator that I spin whenever I have some free time. A while back it landed on Rocky, so I finally started the franchise, and I ended up really enjoying it. I didn’t binge it, but I was super invested, and honestly shocked I’d gone all these years without seeing it. I’d heard about Rocky for a long time, but this was my first time going through every film.

I’m not here to give my personal breakdown or opinion on each movie (although I'd like to 😭I’m sure people have better things to do than read that), but watching Rocky made me realize that even with the hundreds of movies I have seen, I’m still missing out on some incredible stuff.

I got two I'd like to mention:

**Kingdom of the Crystal Skul**l:  The CGI and fridge scene (and Shia LeBouf)  seems to have ruined the movie for some people. I think it's a solid 6/10.  Shia may be a jerk IRL, but I think he's a solid actor, and I really like the wedding ending because of it's openness.  You could see it as a happy closure or the start of something new.  I was fine with the new sci-fi element especially since it has retains religious overtones.

**Nice Guys Sleep Alone:** This is an older independent rom-com not many have probably seen.    It's got low marks (Under 6 on imdb), and the few people I know who saw it didn't really care for it.  I'm not quite sure why.  Then again, I found the male lead quite relatable.

1p1g7mh,Casino (1995) Was So Good It’s Painful,dqcw4al2,Pure-Huckleberry8640,movies,0,0.38,32,1763578240.0,2025-11-19 19:50:40,True,"Kind of random but that movie was so good it kind of ruined movies for me for a while. Like, I use to watch movies more voraciously but now every time I scroll through Prime I’m just thinking “Yeah, it won’t be as good as Casino”. 

I don’t know why Casino in particular but I guess it’s because I never really heard of it and was truly flabbergasted by how solid a film it was. I don’t need to tell you how good this movie is. I really don’t. It’s got one of the most legendary directors directing one of the coolest and most badass actors in the lead role and then Joe Pesci who’s always hilarious. I feel bad he got typecast as the bungling villain from Home Alone because he truly is a dangerous yet funny little munchkin in these gangster movies. He was great in Goodfellas but Pesci’s schtick in Casino was top notch hilarious.

I could describe the plot to you but if you’re at all aware of Martin Scorsese’s style you’ll know what it’s like. It’s a black comedy full of crime of terrible, immoral people slowly getting their comeupance as their criminal empires slip from their grip with things going both hilarious and dangerously wrong. It’s an expertly directed trainwreck of selfish, grimy people making one selfish, grimy decision on top of another until the whole thing implodes and you’re sitting there both laughing and feeling sorry for the cast.

Robert De Niro, though, deserves extra accommodation. I love this man. Whether it’s Goodfellas, Godfather Part 2, Heat or Casino I’m just staring up in ah at how manly, charismatic and cool he is. De Niro is basically the embodiment of every cool trait a guy needs to appear suave and in control on screen and he always brings this otherworldly, near mystic charm with him when he’s on screen. Even though his character, Ace, is kind of immoral, I can’t help but fall in love with him, laughing and fawning over his every move. De Niro is just THAT good at playing a Chad character. I don’t even think the dude needs a script for that. Just put a camera in front of him and he could do near literal magic. He could be on an episode of Barney and it’d be 10/10 cinema.

To give a bit of criticism to Casino though it IS kind of a retread of Goodfellas and Wolf of Wall Street’s subject material but I’m not in the least bit put off by the familiarity. Scorsese’s got the art of the criminal empire downfall epic down and he nails it SO GOOD in this one. The main trio of Ace, Nicky and Ginger perfectly balance likability with flawed and morally absent people whose personal problems aren’t just fun to watch but almost, almost, just a little, heartwarming? It’s a weird style. These guys are the bad guys, they do wrong things, but they’re almost kind of cute in their little ensemble way, like school children always pilfering candy from the store until they get caught and their parents come into spank them. Odd metaphor, I know, but Casino isn’t just another mob or crime movie. 

It’s a film that has this almost magical, otherworldly feel, like, this isn’t Las Vegas, this is the city of dreams and drama. It’s got this upbeat, fun feel that only Scorsese can really weave into a story of criminals. You wouldn’t think you could make a story like this something nostalgic and almost sentimental but it IS. It feels like a fairy tail, like your watching the kings and queens of old showing off their lavish palaces and interpersonal drama but in a way that feels inviting, warm and free rather than pretentious or excessive. The movie does advertise itself as a dark drama, and it is, but it’s got that vibe that these are ”the good old days” for this team of gangsters and high rollers and they‘re living it up. I’m not saying it romanticizes crime but it’s got this level of class, sophistication and lovely cinematic language that combined with excellent pacing make it such a delight to watch. It’s like you’re watching a “best hits of” from a band you loved when you were young and wild and free without going overboard with the kitsch. 

And I’ll never forget Ace’s monologue at the end. Talking about how the Wild West days of Las Vegas are over and Nicky and Ginger are long gone with only him making it out okay. Normally I don’t get misty eyed over a criminal losing their fiefdom but it feels so melancholic and sad hearing Ace say Las Vegas is now like Disneyworld. The film almost jarringly shifts from slightly comedic, high paced dark drama to somber and regretful so quickly. This isn’t a bad thing though, it’s just that that monologue FEELS so different from the rest of the film and yet feels so right, hitting in a place in your mind where you won’t soon forget. If you’ve seen the film recently enough to remember that monologue RoberT De Niro or are convinced to go watch it, tell me what Ace’s last words in the film mean, because there’s a moral here, a lesson, maybe? Something I can quite articulate was said at the end of Casino that really struck a cord with me. Maybe it’s because I’m a person who has a lot of nostalgia and am really triggered by it but it may be the best closing out to any film I’ve ever seen.

And yeah, it’s one of those films that are so good everything else seems kind of “blaaah” in retrospect. Not saying I’ll never love another movie again but everything is gonna feel pretty weak in comparison to Casino for a while. And for a 3 hour flick, it does NOT feel its length. Good job, Scorsese, good job De Niro. You guys earned your weight in gold with your directing and performance. They’re not long for this world and when they finally go, I’m really go to miss them.

Sure, they’re convenient and give the story quickly, but they completely remove the suspense, emotional buildup, and overall experience that makes a movie worth watching in the first place.

As a filmmaker myself, I keep wondering: why isn’t anyone doing anything to stop these channels? Or are people trying, and it just doesn’t work? Is it because of copyright loopholes? Because honestly, it feels weird that someone can take a film people worked years on, cut it into pieces, and retell the story for views.

Are filmmakers actually okay with this? Do studios tolerate it? And if there *are* efforts to stop recap content, why does it keep surviving on YouTube and TikTok?

I’m also curious if anyone genuinely believes recaps are *good* for cinema—like maybe they increase interest or accessibility?

1p19pfo,Exploring the culpability of Fredo in The Godfather Part II,bvpxh,VanDelay_Industry,movies,0,0.43,27,1763563914.0,2025-11-19 15:51:54,True,"Hoping to get some discussion on one of my favorite movies of all time. Obviously there will be spoilers here, but the movie is 50+ years old. I think Godfather Part I and Part II are some of the best examples of ""show, don't tell"" movies of all time and thus reward rewatching. I have seen this movie probably a half dozen times and something that I have gone back and forth on is how deserving Fredo was to be killed at the end of Part II. That leads me to backtrack through the films to determine what he did to determine his level of guilt.  

Big picture, Michael ordered the hit on Fredo because he cooperated with Johnny Ola/Roth which provided them the inside information needed for the attempted murder of Michael and his wife that takes place in the beginning of the movie. This makes sense.  

  

However, towards the end of the film, Fredo gives a teary confession to Michael, saying that he didn't know that they were going to try to hit Michael. He just wanted something for his own, he was passed over for his younger brother and no one has ever respected him. Johnny Ola convinces Fredo that by passing information to Roth, Fredo will end up getting more independence from his brother and more respect from the Corleone family. This also makes sense and also explains why I feel sad watching Fredo get killed. Sure, he betrayed his family but he did so with somewhat positive intent, he didn't mean for this to happen.  

  

Here's what's confusing to me: what information *exactly* would Fredo need to pass to Johnny Ola/Roth that would allow them to try to take out Michael?   

1. They mention after the attempted murder that one of the bodyguards ""disappeared"" after the attack (I take this to mean that Fredo provided information to Johnny Ola about which guards would be susceptible to bribes to look the other way.)  
2. They knew the exact room from the outside of the house that Michael slept in.  
3. The fact that Michael kept the windows open during the summer time while he slept.  

If you assume that this is the type of information that Fredo provided, how can you also take his teary confession that he was played by Johnny Ola and didn't know they were going to attack Michael? What did Fredo think Johnny Ola would do with this information? I know that Fredo is often portrayed as being the dumb one who no one respects but surely he would know that this sensitive information regarding the security of his brother would put his brother's life at risk?  

  

So I ask.. was Fredo just a dumb puppet played by Johnny Ola and Roth with his head in the sand? Or was Fredo at least somewhat aware of what the outcomes would be of his actions?",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p19pfo/exploring_the_culpability_of_fredo_in_the/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p19pfo/exploring_the_culpability_of_fredo_in_the/,Discussion,False,False,True,False,2025-11-19,15,Wednesday

Watching this evening I noticed something that I've been unable to find via any google search.



In the early scenes of the movie, we see Russell and Lena (Bale and Saldana, respectively) in bed together before Russell has to leave to go to work. 



Near the climax/ending of the film, as Russell is setting his trap for Harlan (Woody Harrelson) in motion, at 1:34:00, we see what Wesley (Forest Whitaker), Lena, and Dan (Tom Bower) are doing, and Lena is laying by herself in a bed with the same exact sheets as earlier in the movie. Nearly an hour and a half has gone by since those sheets got about 45 seconds of screen-time, but they are pretty distinctive. She is certainly back in Russell's bed, and given the contemporaneity of the cuts to the other characters, it would be nonsensical to be a flashback. 



Flaws remain with the ending, but I think the idea that Russell and Lena are back together, at least to some degree, and Russell is once again jeopardizing his relationship with Lena with potential jail-time to avenge his brother does improve the ending somewhat. Russell's brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) and Rodney's debt is the reason Russell was out at the bar the night he hit and killed someone, sending him to prison and ruining his life and relationship with Lena. Rodney is once again the motivator for Russell to risk arrest. Finally, this also leaves a lot of questions as to why Wesley would protect Russell by not turning him in after witnessing him kill Harlon. 



Any thoughts or am I making too much of this? Has anyone noticed this before?

I'll start with one that's probably not that shocking a take anymore: 300 is a fascist film. It's extremely hard to watch after gaining any sort of political consciousness and not see that the core themes of the films are the virtues of a homogenous, traditional society and how much democracy sucks and how everything would have been fine if the ubermensch king Leonidas wasn't hamstrung by democratic institutions.

1ozv0vn,"November 14-16 Box Office Recap – 'Now You See Me: Now You Don't' opens with a solid $21M domestically and $75.2M worldwide. 'The Running Man' flops with just $16.4M domestically and $27.6M worldwide, against a $110M budget. 'Predator: Badlands' collapses a steep 68%, but crosses $130M worldwide.",15vcho,SanderSo47,movies,126,0.83,50,1763419678.0,2025-11-17 23:47:58,True,"https://preview.redd.it/8x45ohvfbw1g1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e5bde46bef47f0915d87647a50d65c4841348f3

Prior to this weekend, it was expected to be a competitive weekend, with three films trying to reach the #1 spot. But it was ***Now You See Me: Now You Don't*** who triumphed in the end, showing there's still interest in the franchise after 9 years. Paramount's ***The Running Man*** suffered a very poor weekend, while ***Predator: Badlands*** had a brutal second weekend drop. Neon's ***Keeper*** also didn't really light the box office on fire.

The Top 10 earned a combined $68.5 million this weekend. That's up 4.1% from last year, when ***Red One*** debuted at #1.

Debuting at #1, ***Now You See Me: Now You Don't*** debuted with $21 million in 3,403 theaters. That's the franchise's lowest debut; the original debuted with $29 million, and the sequel made $22 million. 

Considering the film's $90 million budget (the most expensive in the franchise), this is not a particularly great start. But this is a franchise that has relied on the overseas markets (we'll get to that later on), so it seems like the domestic market isn't a priority. Lionsgate pretty much sold the film with everything people loved about the franchise: ridiculous magic heists. By this point, you already know what you're getting. And the mixed reviews (59% on RT) won't dissuade those skeptical.

According to Lionsgate, 54% of the audience was female, and 66% was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which is the lowest in the franchise (the previous films attained an ""A–""). That's not a great score, and suggests that the film could lose some steam, especially with some heavy hitters coming up. Barring some strong legs, it will probably cap off at $55 million domestically, which would make it the lowest-grossing title in the franchise. 

In second place, we find the real loser. Paramount's ***The Running Man*** flopped with just $16.4 million in 3,534 theaters. It's not even Edgar Wright's highest debut (***Baby Driver*** made $20 million on its first weekend), which is quite terrible considering its high $110 million budget. It also managed to open below the 1987 film in terms of attendance ($23.2 million adjusted).

Despite the emphasis on PLF screens and with a name like Glen Powell in the leading role, ***The Running Man*** had some challenges that it couldn't overcome. Even though this is not exactly a remake of the 1987 film, audiences don't have fond memories of that film (it wasn't a hit even when Arnold Schwarzenegger was in his prime), so the association doesn't fully help.

The debut marked Wright's second big-budget flop (***Scott Pilgrim vs. the World*** also flopped in theaters back in 2010, even though it found an audience in DVD), and his second failure in a row (***Last Night in Soho*** in 2021). Wright has his fans, but he's not at that level of recognition for general audiences. Glen Powell has also been in some successes, but it simply looks like ***Anyone but You*** was the right movie at the right time. Yes, ***Twisters*** was successful, but that's because of the spectacle and VFX, not the cast. Audiences still don't associate Powell as a leading action star.

There's also the question over whether audiences wanted to check a film following a dystopian version of America. With high tensions currently in the country and the world, perhaps audiences decided to pass on this one. And even though Wright has made some acclaimed films, ***The Running Man*** was his weakest film critically-wise (a middling 65% on RT). So it looks like something that didn't attract general audiences, and will leave Wright's fans underwhelmed.

According to Paramount, 64% of the audience was male, which means Powell's presence failed to attract women. It also skewed old; 46% of the audience was 35 and over. They gave it a middling ""B+"" on CinemaScore, the same grade that the 1987 film got. Without great word of mouth and ***Wicked*** coming up to take its PLF screens, ***The Running Man*** might not last long in theaters. Right now, the film should finish with around $45 million domestically, which means it will sell less tickets than the 1987 film ($108.9 million adjusted). No way Wright's ***Barbarella*** reboot with Sydney Sweeney happens now, right?

In third place, ***Predator: Badlands*** earned $12.7 million. That's a very steep 68% drop, the worst in the franchise. Even ***The Predator*** dropped ""just"" 62%, and that's with very poor word of mouth. Despite the positive reception, the loss of PLF screens hurt the film. But it truly looks like the film's fanbase wasn't as big as anticipated; hardcore fans led to an over-performing opening weekend, but general audiences weren't particularly interested.

Through 10 days, the film has earned $66 million, becoming the highest grossing mainline film unadjusted. But it's clear that the franchise has a ceilling. While the opening weekend suggested $100 million, it looks like ***Predator: Badlands*** will finish with around $85-$90 million domestically.

***Regretting You*** dropped 44%, adding $3.7 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $44.6 million, and it should close with almost $55 million.

In fifth place, Universal's ***Black Phone 2*** dipped 49% and added $2.6 million. The film has earned $74.6 million so far.

Debuting in sixth place, Neon's ***Keeper*** earned an underwhelming $2.5 million in 1,950 theaters. This debut is nowhere close to Osgood Perkins' previous films, ***Longlegs*** ($22.4 million) nor ***The Monkey*** ($14 million), which were the biggest debuts in Neon's history.

The budget was kept low at $6 million, so this is not a bad start. But it sure feels kinda underwhelming, considering Perkins was responsible for two hits for Neon. But the thing with ***Keeper*** is that it lacked a hook or an interesting premise: a couple spending a weekend at a cabin isn't as exciting as a serial killer thriller or a wind-up monkey that kills people around it. The film also lacked the hype; it's sitting at a mediocre 51% on RT, which is below the previously mentioned titles.

And the future is not looking bright for ***Keeper***. Audiences gave the film a horrible ""D+"" on CinemaScore, indicating toxic word of mouth, even by horror standards. With numbers like these, ***Keeper*** will disappear quickly from theaters. It'd be a surprise if it made it past $6 million domestically.

Sony Pictures Classics' ***Nuremberg*** had the best drop in the Top 10. It eased just 37%, adding $2.4 million this weekend. Through 10 days, it has earned $8.4 million, and it should finish with almost $15 million domestically. Much higher than anticipated.

***Sarah's Oil*** dipped 47% for a $2.2 million. The film's domestic total stands at $8.5 million, and it should finish with around $14 million.

In ninth place, ***Bugonia*** dropped 53%, earning $1.6 million this weekend. The film has earned $15.6 million, and it should finish with a little over $20 million.

Rounding out the Top 10 was ***Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc***. It dropped 55%, earning $1.5 million. That takes its domestic total to $41.1 million.

Ahead of ***Wicked: For Good***, Universal re-released ***Wicked*** in 2,195 theaters and it earned $1.2 million. That took its lifetime total to $474.4 million.

Unsurprisingly, MUBI's ***Die My Love*** crashed hard on its second weekend. It collapsed 66%, earning just $888,017. The film has earned a meager $4.8 million, and it will finish with just $6 million.

Neon expanded ***Sentimental Value*** to 28 theaters, and it earned a pretty great $380,244. A very solid $13,580 per-theater average. Neon will continue expanding the film over the next few weeks, hoping to capitalize on some Oscar buzz.

#**OVERSEAS**

Even though ***Now You See Me: Now You Don't*** didn't have a great start domestically, it more than made up with its overseas debut. The film earned a strong $54.2 million overseas, for a $75.2 million worldwide debut. In a rare ocurrence, China posted a higher debut than America, with $21.7 million. It also had solid debuts in Russia ($6.4M), Latin America ($5.5M), South Korea ($3.9M), France ($3.5M) and the UK ($3.2M). There are still some markets left, so the film should recoup its $90 million investment.

***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle*** finally made its debut in China, and it posted an incredible $52.5 million. With this debut, it has now surpassed $700 million worldwide, with a running total of $730 million.

***Predator: Badlands*** added $16.1 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $136.2 million. The best markets are China ($12.7M), UK ($5.6M), Mexico ($4M), France ($3.7M) and Japan ($3.3M). By next week, it should pass ***The Predator*** to become the highest grossing mainline title in the franchise. 

***The Running Man*** also disappointed overseas, debuting with just $11.2 million, for a poor $27.6 million worldwide debut. It had very soft debuts in the the UK ($3.3M), Germany ($1.1M), Australia ($1M), Mexico ($659K) and the UAE ($391K). Even though it has so many markets left, this is a very bad way to start and suggests that reaching $100 million worldwide will be a big challenge. Without much hope, a high $110 million budget, and a very extensive marketing campaign, this is gonna rank as one of the year's biggest flops.

With $1.4 million overseas, ***One Battle After Another*** has officially crossed $200 million worldwide. It's Leonardo DiCaprio's 12th film to reach that milestone.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*The Bad Guys 2* | Aug/1 | Universal | $21,995,715 | $82,593,605 | $237,247,060 | $80M
*Good Boy* | Oct/3 | IFC Films | $2,343,694 | $6,624,062 | $8,774,059 | $70K

- Universal/DreamWorks' ***The Bad Guys 2*** has closed with a pretty great $82 million domestically and $237 million worldwide. That's not far off from the original's $250 million total, so this should be enough to greenlight a third installment. 

- IFC Films' ***Good Boy*** has closed with $6 million domestically and $8 million worldwide. Pretty fantastic, considering its ultra low $70,000 budget. It may not be a lot of money, but given the small scale of the film, it's not bad at all.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

Three wide releases, but only one is heading for a historic box office run.

That's Universal's ***Wicked: For Good***, the conclusion to the two-parter that began last year. Not only continuing the storyline, but also taking place during the events of ***The Wizard of Oz***. Universal has mounted a very aggressive marketing campaign, and it has paid off so far. Fandango is reporting that the film is posting one of the biggest pre-sales for a PG-rated title. It's not a matter of whether it will open higher than the first film (that's pretty much guaranteed). The question is if it will be strong enough to overtake ***A Minecraft Movie*** ($162M) for the biggest debut of the year.

Searchlight is releasing ***Rental Family***, which stars Brendan Fraser as a lonely American actor living in Tokyo starts working for a Japanese rental family service to play stand-in roles in other people's lives. Fraser is currently on a good run, and the film is hoping to become a crowdpleaser with audiences. Reviews out of TIFF are very positive, so could this surprise?

Sony is also releasing ***Sisu: Road to Revenge***, the sequel to ***Sisu***. It offers exactly what you loved about the original: a WWII film with brutal action. Let's see how it fares.

add to that, they are right back in the water with the Mosasaur and the Spinos, that already destroyed 2 boats, and they specifically said the mosasaur circles the island to hunt.

even if they somehow make it past the dinos in the ocean, what are the chances they make it to civilization in a Zodiac, with no extra fuel, no paddles, no food, no water, also, they said that there are almost no patrols, because who would be stupid enough to go near that island.

ALSO ALSO, thier plan, to open source the samples. how would a couple of mercenaries, and an out of work museum coordinator/archeologist even open source 3 tissue samples from dinos?

and even if they did, doesnt that just mean that the big pharma company still gets the samples? they just dont have to pay the 100m that they were promised. because if they make the samples free to everyone, the big pharma company would get them too. and all they needed was the samples to bring thier drug to testing. it would put them like a decade in front of anyone else. they would still make untold billions or trillions curing heart disease before anyone else could bring a drug to market.

Built a home theater mainly out of components I bought off of Craigslist. (What a steal!) This weekend I had the best movie party yet, and we watched *The Empire Strikes Back.* A couple days before I had people over, I was thinking about how exciting it was going to be to have a bunch of people in the room with me watching this amazing movie the first time I got to hear this song on my nice sound system.

It got me thinking... Is there a single piece of movie music more iconic than Darth Vader's theme, *ever*? Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of amazing pieces of movie score I can recall, and I can think of at least several that are *comparably* famous to this one. But every song that comes to mind, I can't help thinking – yeah, that's a famous song, but Darth Vader's theme is *definitely* EVEN MORE famous.

I think it's the most famous *Star Wars* song, even moreso than the title theme. Is there a serious competitor, or is this just clearly the most iconic movie music ever?

EDIT: Of the answers I've received so far, I think ""Over the Rainbow"" is clearly the most fitting. What a banger. That's definitely in contention.

EDIT 2: I should have mentioned *Jaws* in my last edit, since that one was on my mind even before I posted. It's clearly in the same ""weight class,"" so to speak. But I think Vader's theme is clearly more iconic even than that.

EDIT 3: Seems like if there's ever going to be an answer somewhat widely agreed upon, it's the theme from *Jaws*.

**Synopsis:**

One year into their marriage, Teresa (Madison Lanesey) and Drew (Travis Quentin Young) head to the tropical paradise of Bocas del Toro, Panamá, for a long-overdue honeymoon. But as the lush setting strips away their daily routines, Teresa’s perception of her “golden boy” husband begins to shift. When she becomes captivated by Paz (Arta Gee)—a free-spirited expat managing their rental—Teresa proposes an unconventional idea to rekindle their connection… leading to unexpected consequences.

1980 had some pretty stupendous films such as Ordinary People, The Elephant Man, and Raging Bull, but I'd consider The Shining above them all. There a handful of incredible films to not receive a single nomination throughout history, but what I'd say separates The Shining, is the number of nominations it was deserving of. There were so many categories where a win or at least a nomination should have happened.

The Shining may not have been Stanley Kubrick's most influential film, but it was Kubrick's most spotless. Is this the biggest screw up in the history of the Oscars, it must be.

1p0t99e,I think I found a way to fix the Old Biff problem in Back To The Future 2,gg2r2,splago,movies,0,0.16,14,1763512960.0,2025-11-19 01:42:40,True,"Okay, so I'm not 100% sure this is the right sub for this one, but it seems the logical place to start.  I was rewatching BTTF2 and it bugged me how Old Biff steals the DeLorean in 2015, goes back to 1955, gives himself the almanac, and then returns to the same 2015 Doc and Marty are in.  That shouldn't be possible, since it breaks the movie's own rules - the second he hands off the book in 1955, the future tangents.  Old Biff should have returned to a tangential 2015 resulting from that event, leaving Doc and Marty stranded without the DeLorean.    
I didn't realize it, but apparently this is a pretty well-known problem with the movie, and people have tried to explain and make it work...even Zemekis.  

I think I might have figured out a clean way to make the whole problem work without breaking anything in the movie (go with me on this, it'll take a minute to explain):

What if Biff handing himself the almanac in 1955 didn't just create a tangent *timeline*, but also a tangent *Biff*? At the moment of the handoff, two versions of Biff exist from that point forward. One version is the “normal” one that becomes Old Biff — the one whose life always played out without the almanac ever influencing anything. That Biff figured Old Biff was just some crazy old man, threw the almanac away, and forgot about it. He grows old, finds the DeLorean in 2015, steals the almanac (maybe realizing he screwed up when he was young and now he's determined to correct his earlier mistake), goes back, hands himself the thing, and then returns to his own 2015. So, in Old Biff's personal timeline, giving himself the almanac changed nothing. His life still led to the moment where he steals the Time Machine, and he returns to the future he came from - the one where he failed to make use of the almanac at all.

The *other*  Biff — the tangent version — is the one whose life *was* altered by receiving the book. He’s the one who uses it, becomes a billionaire, and creates the hellscape Trump-inspired 1985. But that version of Biff isn't the Old Biff who stole the DeLorean in the first place. 

So that's why Old Biff returns the DeLorean in 2015 in the same timeline he started in. He’s following his own personal history, not the global “new” timeline created by the almanac. He’s essentially anchored to the version of 2015 that produced him.

But...

Doc and Marty don’t travel along *their* personal timeline when they fly back to 1985. Time travelers in BTTF don’t always “follow their own timeline”; they travel to whatever version of a target time exists *after a causal change*.  If they pick a different destination, they jump into whatever version of that time currently exists. So when Doc and Marty time-jump from 2015 back to 1985, they don’t land in the 1985 they personally remember — they land in the 1985 created by tangent Young Biff’s actions.  Old Biff returned *backward* along his own personal timeline; Doc and Marty travel *forward* into a timeline that results from the changes made in 2955.

This is supported by Doc’s chalkboard speech, when he says “we cannot return to the future, because it no longer exists!” And it mirrors what happens in the first film, too: when Marty goes back to 1985, he ends up in the *current* version of 1985, not the one he grew up in.

ALSO, this makes Old Biff’s collapse after returning the DeLorean make more sense. He interacted with a past that *wasn’t* actually part of his own history. His body is basically stuck between two different sets of events and starts to fade like Marty did in the first movie. He returns the car, walks out, and dies because he’s coming apart under the strain of having just meddled in a timeline that invalidates his existence.

...I kinda feel like I'm missing the punchline here, but that's basically the idea.  So far as I can tell this follows the movies' rules completely, so it all reconciles.  But I'm still not 100% sure.  Am I wrong?",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p0t99e/i_think_i_found_a_way_to_fix_the_old_biff_problem/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p0t99e/i_think_i_found_a_way_to_fix_the_old_biff_problem/,Discussion,False,False,False,False,2025-11-19,1,Wednesday

But for this conversation, I wanted to learn more about unmade films where it actually is a 50/50 chance it would've been a masterpiece or it would fail badly, and of course because they're unmade, we can never truly know what it would've been like. For some examples I thought of:

\- 21 Jump Street 3 (where they tie-in to Men in Black series): While it sounds so crazy and way off, remember how they did both a remake of an old series and sequel that are both considered great films, so there is also the chance that the filmmakers would've also struck gold again.

\- Jodorowsky's Dune: From all the concept art and the documentary, many say that this would've been a dud and really bad. However, considering the talent of Alejandro Jodorowsky, history of risky films that ended up successful, how many talented artists were behind it, and the possibility of improvising with a surprisinhly small budget for the scale of his vision, it might've still sucked as an adaptation but could've been a masterpiece in sci-fi arthouse cinema

\- A Topiary (and to an extent The Modern Ocean): While the scripts have been released and are really weird and cryptic, had Shane Carruth obtained the funding to these films, he could've used his filmmaking process that we don't see, and with the proper actors it could've been a much more interesting film than what our imaginations can give us.

However just thinking about the premise of being injured but not feeling the pain of it makes me wince.

This is unusual for me because I'm a horror fan and have seen some really disturbing simulated injuries in movies while still enjoying the experience over all.

Do you remember your favorite actors based on their best work? The way they make you feel?   Something else?

In my case, my favorite actor before now has been Michael Crawford - OG Phantom of the Opera (my favorite show). When I heard the cast recording of the original, I fell in love with his voice.  I then watched another of his shows (London West End, on DVD), and just fell in love again with his incredible talent. He was (still alive) an incredible comedian as well, who did all his own stunts. So with Michael, I was/am so drawn to his talent

Now I’m doing a deep dive on Al Pacino, and in many ways it’s similar to why I was drawn to Michael: extraordinary talent.  But it’s more than that for me, and so the same reason I love him is the same reason I will remember him.  Al loves words, he loves language. He is passionate about acting - more than that even, Al has said he HAD to do it, there was something in him, that he was born to act.

Sidney Lumet said this once, and it can’t be said any better:

“Everything stems from some incredible core inside of him. I wouldn’t think of trying to get near it, because it would be like getting somewhere near the center of the earth. What comes out of his core is so uniquely his own.”

I love words, and language, so I adore any monologue he does - and he has some great ones here, particularly the scene, when he’s ripping his bosses a new one for essentially quitting the story. 

The moment when Wallace betrays him, his face says it all - his soul is crushed. He said so much without saying a word - I was heartbroken for him.   Later, at the end, when he tells Wallace that what was broken can never be fixed - such a quietly sad moment. The stakes were real here - lives were affected.

I’ll end on this:

According to Russell Crowe, both he and Pacino were being considered for Oscar campaigns. When consulted, Pacino told the studio to ""back the kid"" meaning Crowe.

This was when Crowe wasn't a major star, before Gladiator made him huge. Years later, when Cinderella Man was making its own Oscar push, Crowe and Paul Giammati (sic) were in the frame. Crowe told the studio to ""back the kid...""

1p0jyzp,Ever Wonder Why Some Movies Hit Hard?,7avziaa7,TheBr14n,movies,0,0.23,6,1763491020.0,2025-11-18 19:37:00,True,"I used to think some movies just magically hit harder than others. You know that feeling, when the credits roll and you just sit there, weirdly emotional, like the film reached inside your ribcage and rearranged something.

For a long time, I chalked it up to “good acting” or “nice cinematography,” because that’s all I really knew how to notice. Then I tried writing my own stories… and they came out about as emotionally powerful as a soggy napkin.

One night, after complaining to a friend about why my characters felt flat, they suggested I try reading actual screenplays. Not summaries. Not YouTube breakdowns. The real scripts. I figured, why not? Worst case, I’d fall asleep.

Instead, I fell into a rabbit hole.

I grabbed a few scripts and used some screenplay analysis tools from [Greenlight Coverage](https://glcoverage.com/) just to help me track scene purposes, plot beats, and character changes. Nothing fancy, mostly highlighting, beat markers, little notes like “THIS is where the character gets cornered” or “emotional reversal here.”

And suddenly, movies I’d already watched dozens of times made sense in a way they never had before.

There was always a turn. Always a shift. A question was raised. A wound poked. A choice forced.

It wasn’t accidental. These writers were engineering emotions.

When I went back to one of my old drafts, it hit me how many scenes I’d written where nothing changed and characters just sat around talking because I liked the dialogue. Cool for vibes, terrible for a story.

So I tried applying what I learned:

Every scene had to do something.

Every character had to want something and fail or succeed in a way that pushed things forward.

Every emotional moment had to have a setup earlier, even a tiny one.

It didn’t magically turn me into a screenwriter overnight, but it made my writing feel alive for the first time. And honestly, it made watching movies more fun too, like seeing all the gears spinning under the story.

Now, whenever a film hits hard, I can usually point to the exact beat where the writer set the emotional trap. And instead of ruining the magic, knowing how it works actually makes it feel even more impressive.

Who knew reading scripts would be the cheat code I needed?",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p0jyzp/ever_wonder_why_some_movies_hit_hard/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p0jyzp/ever_wonder_why_some_movies_hit_hard/,Discussion,False,False,False,False,2025-11-18,19,Tuesday

1p00f52,Sabrina 1954 vs 1995: in defense of Sabrina 1954,pl1lmhst,meldoc81,movies,0,0.5,14,1763433847.0,2025-11-18 03:44:07,True,"Had to write this after watching the remake.

Also full disclosure, I saw Sabrina 1954 first… a week ago. And then watched the remake yesterday and today.

This is also going to be very subjective.

Listen, I do not need a remake to be a 1 to 1 copy of the original. I am fine with changes in theory. But the changes need to have purpose. And as far as I can tell, the remake half-assed its changes. It’s too afraid to strain too much from the structure of the original film, but its new content conflicts with that original script. It’s the 90s equivalent of a modern Disney remake. And in the words of Ron Leslie,

Never half-ass two things. Full ass one thing.

Let’s start with the most basic issue. Sabrina herself.

For, what I can only assume was an attempt to differentiate itself from the original, Sabrina no longer goes from lovesick youngin to bold, confident, woman. Instead it’s lovesick shy youngin to lovesick shy hot woman. And I’m sorry, this is just painful to watch. Between the sullen silences, her constant inability to make up her mind, and all the sad sappy poetry type dialogue, it made. 2 hour film feel like 3 hours. In the words of my friend, it’s like watching a sitcom.

The reason Sabrina is such a magnetic force in the original isn’t just the fact she is played by Audrey Hepburn. It’s the fact Audrey imbues the character with so much confidence when she’s returns back from Paris that it’s infectious. From the moment she’s back she has David wrapped around her finger.

*“You’re still reaching for the moon Sabrina.”*

*“No father, the moon is reaching for **me.**”*

At the party, by the time David gets to her she’s already got a group of men surrounding her. She doesn’t blend in, she intentionally stands out. She does not care that she’s about to ruin a 20+ million dollar merger deal. Come hell or high water she is going to go after the love of her life.

If you are going to 180 that, make her still as meek as ever but she got a glow up, then you have to justify why David is infatuated with her. Why he’d be willing to throw everything away for her. In the remake it makes even less sense given he’s actually been dating his fiancé and approach her first. Whereas in the original, David’s marriage was cooked up entirely by Linus. It makes sense that he’d fall back into old habits, even intentionally staining his fiancé’s dress, just for the chance to be with Sabrina. He never truly believed in his arraigned marriage in the first place.

Yet in the remake, the only thing David seems to be into is her looks. Like he’s just using her as an excuse to get out of an engagement he’s iffy on. He doesn’t even stain his fiancé’s dress because she’s not even at the party. Not only that, but they actually have more scenes together after the party, but it’s still worse because Sabrina has no confidence. She realizes she’s falling for Linus and starts to awkwardly shy away from David because she feels guilty. So what you end up with is no chemistry.

Again, compare that to William Holden and Audrey Hepburn. Where the chemistry is so clearly there despite them having far less screentime that people TO THIS DAY wish Sabrina had gotten with David instead.

And can I just say it is hilarious the 90s remake somehow de-girlbossed Sabrina? 1954 Sabrina knew what she wanted and went for it. 1995 Sabrina can’t make up her mind even after her Paris trip.

Part of me is hurt because in theory, I want a remake to go bold with the changes. But the problem is by keeping the bones, the structure of the original film, plot points cease to make sense. Like they’re thrown in there because they were there in the original. 

Which leads to the second victim of this film’s bizarre relationship to the original. 

Linus Laraby.

Linus in the remake has the charisma of a piece of wet cardboard, so he’s naturally a fit for this Sabrina. Who is too shy to even pretend to play coy. He’s awkward, and not in an endearing way. Neither Linus nor Sabrina are good at messing with each other here either. No thinly veiled threats, feigning ignorance. Just very, very awkward pauses.

The best way to describe the difference is the lead up to when they first dance.

In the original, the exchange is this,

**Sabrina:** *You know, when you just walked in here, I was sure you’d been sent by the family to deal with me.*

**Linus:** *To deal with you?*

**Sabrina:** *Like in a Viennese operetta. The young prince falls in love with the waitress at the gala, and the prime minister is sent to buy her off.*

**Linus:** *Buy her off?*

**Sabrina:** *Yes. He offers her 5,000 Krone. No she says. 10,000? No.*

**Linus:** *15,000 Krone.*

**Sabrina:** *No.*

**Linus:** *20,000 Krone.*

**Sabrina:** *No.*

**Linus:** *25,000 dollars.*

**Sabrina:** *No… how did dollars get into this?*

**Linus:** *25,000 after taxes is a lot of money Sabrina.*

**Sabrina:** *What are you trying to say?*

**Linus:** *Oh I’m just trying to make it worth while. What’s a Krone these days? No self respecting prime minister would offer Krone.*

**Sabrina:** *No self respecting waitress would take dollars.*

**Linus:** *Good girl.*

Meanwhile in the 1995

**Sabrina:** *They’ve sent you to deal with me, haven’t they?*

**Linus:** *They?*

**Sabrina:** *Like a lawyer in a movie. He goes to the unsuitable waitress or showgirl or chauffeur’s daughter, and say the family is prepared to offer you 100 thousand dollars to stay away from their son. No she says. 150 thousand?*

**Linus:** *200 thousand.*

**pause**

**Sabrina:** *No.*

**Linus:** *A million.*

**longer pause**

**Linus:** *No self respecting lawyer would offer less.*

**Sabrina:** *No self respecting waitress, would take it.*

**Linus:** *Good girl.*

There is so much push and pull in the original. Linus always stops short of saying he is actually there to buy her off. But Sabrina, to a degree, knows better. The moment it’s starting to become transparent she calls him out. Only for Linus to retreat, and go for plan B. Seducing her.

Meanwhile the remake makes a change at the start of this conversation I neglected to mention. It moves Linus’ lie that he’s okay with David and Sabrina getting together to after the movie analogy. By changing this, they have Sabrina come right out and ask if “they,” sent Linus to deal with her. And Linus, caught, focuses on the “they,” because it means Sabrina didn’t think Linus himself wanted her out of the picture. Meanwhile in the original, Linus feigns ignorance and changes the subject.

This change recontextualizes the whole exchange. It’s far less playful. More awkward, threatening even. Linus’ “good girl,” doesn’t come off as playful. It’s more like a “grrrrr I’m gonna have to try harder to get rid of you.” Before he pretends to be okay with Sabrina and David. Which you may be like “wait what’s the problem here? It looks like they’re changing the story to fit these new characters.” Again, they don’t fully commit. After Linus so clearly and with not even a hint of plausible deniability tries to buy Sabrina off, he suddenly 180s and he’s like “oh no I won’t stop you, it’s the 90s Sabrina.” And she buys it? And then she willingly dances with him?

How?

What?

Why?

The dance itself is awkward as hell. And the way he rushes for the kiss, saying it’s all in the family, I’m just like WHY?!?

I can’t chalk this up to Harrison Ford phoning in his performance though that certainly is part of it. It goes back to someone’s choice during the script writing process to remove Linus’ charisma.

Humphrey Bogart’s Linus’ use of “it’s all in the family,” is repeated over and over prior to the kiss as a way to put Sabrina at ease as he seduces her. It starts off small, with Linus being the one to appear and offer the champaign that David would normally arrive with. Then he moves to the dance. And then, he suggests Sabrina would expect a kiss from David, offers a kiss from David, and then kisses her. Just as Sabrina is questioning what she let herself do, he interrupts that thought with, “it’s all in the family.”

It’s all a game to manipulate her into questioning her feelings for David. To lightly push her in the so called right direction. Unfortunately for Linus, he starts to fall for her in the process.

All I feel in the remake is tension, like Linus is a predator trying to scare but also steal Sabrina away. And she is unsettled by his every advance. None of its subtle or suave. Yet I’m supposed to believe they’re falling in love?

In the original this is the moment Sabrina starts to consider Linus as an option. Whereas in the remake, I’m at the halfway point in the movie and I do not see how Linus can salvage it. And in my opinion, he doesn’t!

The Martha’s vineyard trip is another exercise in annoyance. It’s bigger, more fancy, Linus clearly trying to show off with the helicopter ride and then the private jet. The pretending the abandoned building has been donated to the city to be used as a halfway house.

All just cringe.

And I don’t feel like these are intentional changes to better fit this version of the story. 

It’s like a Disney remake where they make changes to be different but don’t follow through with it. They’re just to make it I guess less problematic. And that thought process goes in tow with the remake’s biggest change.

Sabrina and Linus never try to kill themselves.

Yes, I do think this is a meaningful change. In spite of the odd choice in plot point, Sabrina’s attempted suicide in the original is her and Linus’ first meeting. They actually talk to each other. They banter even though she literally almost died. Linus even brings it up when he sees her at the tennis court. Moreover this is actually setup for Sabrina being able to relate to Linus and see there’s more to him than the stuffy businessman. Because Linus too, almost killed himself because of heartbreak.

The fact they’d both been to this place is what intrigues Sabrina enough for another date after the second one. It’s literally the first thing she asks him about when she visits his office before their third date. Sharing this information is what helps Linus himself be more open to Sabrina and vise versa. It gives Sabrina a reason to trust him. That despite his crusty shell and her endless energy, there’s an intense loneliness they share.

Meanwhile in the remake, no such moment. They replace the garage scene from the 54 film with Sabrina accidentally, drunkenly, confessing her love for David, to Linus.

Also wanted to add the painfully on the nose yet genius framing of when Sabrina is cooking dinner while Linus is outside looking over the ledge at the cruise ship. There’s two different things happening here. Linus is metaphorically thinking about ending his life. Giving up his all day businessman job and running off with her. But also, what separates Sabrina from in this shot? Glass.

In the words of Sabrina’s father,

*”I like to think of life as a limousine. Though we are all riding together, we must remember our places. There's a front seat and a back seat and a window in between.”*

Remake Sabrina and Linus wear their loneliness on their sleeves. So many long awkward pauses. The movie seems aware they don’t actually have the moment where the two become stuck so to speak, where it should click that they’re in love. So instead, while eating Moroccan food, the film montages the two laughing and joking together. As if it gave up on trying to show how these two very lonely, very socially awkward people, would even get to that point. Because the second the montage is over it’s back to Linus acting like a creep and Sabrina being weirded out.

Listen, my biggest complaint about the original is Linus. More specifically Humphrey Bogart was too old, plain and simple. So I take no joy in saying Harrison Ford is worse. All the changes made were for the worse and what they keep does not work with the story they are trying to tell.

I could go on, how the remake changed it so Linus announces his Paris trip in the same scene where he asks Sabrina to go with him. And then has him do a 180 like “no I was lying this was a mistake.” The bottom line is the same.

The remake simultaneously changes too much and too little. And the result is a very frustrating movie. If you haven’t seen the original film, it might be a fine time. But there’s so much here that is just odd, and is only there because of the OG movie.

It’s a movie at war with itself, and in the process loses.

Hi everyone! I work as a rabbi’s secretary at a small synagogue, and I’ve somehow become the unofficial curator of our brand-new weekly family movie night. I’m a lifelong movie lover, and I’d really love to use this as a way to introduce the kids (and their parents and my own six year old daughter) to film as an art form, not just the loudest or newest thing on streaming.

We’re starting with An American Tail (obviously), and I’d love to include more Jewish-centered films where I can. But since there aren’t quite enough Jewish family movies, we’re also building a list of great, thoughtful, kid-friendly films from everywhere. I have been collecting ideas and here’s what I’ve got so far: 

The Adventures of Prince Achmed

The Bear

The Black Stallion

The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse (plus assorted animated shorts)

The Cameraman

The Circus

Ernest & Celestine

Fantastic Mr. Fox

Flow

The Freshman (1925)

Good Morning

Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio

Hugo

The Incredibles

The Iron Giant

Journey to the Beginning of Time

The Kid (1921)

The Kid Brother

Kiki’s Delivery Service (1989)

The Last Unicorn

The Lego Movie

The Little Prince

A Little Princess

Long Way North

Mary Poppins

The Muppet Movie

My Neighbor Totoro

The NeverEnding Story

Paddington / Paddington 2

The Peanut Butter Falcon

Pee-wee’s Big Adventure

Ponyo

The Princess Bride

Ratatouille

The Red Balloon (and other Lamorisse shorts)

The Red Turtle

The Secret Garden (1993)

The Secret of Kells

Shaun the Sheep Movie

Song of the Sea

The Sound of Music

Speedy

Spirited Away

The Tale of the Princess Kaguya

WALL-E

Whale Rider

Where Is the Friend’s House?

Whisper of the Heart

The Wizard of Oz

Wolfwalkers

I’d love suggestions for anything I might be missing—especially visually striking films, silent films, international films, or anything with a strong moral or spiritual center (Jewish or not). Basically: movies that kids can fall in love with now and appreciate even more when they’re older.

The set-up is standard cops & robbers fare with the good guy looking for revenge on the bad guy that murdered his partner.

Ironically his quarry Eric ""Rick"" Masters (Willem Dafoe) has more in common with him than his colleagues. Sadistic New Wave dandy Rick is an artist/forger with exacting standards. He also seems to relish the high stakes cat & mouse game.

Director William Friedkin sets a  kinetic pace early on that rarely lets up. This is aided by score by the band Wang Chung. It's percussive & driving in a way that makes you feel on edge.

The big set piece the film is known for is the nearly 10 minute long chase scene. As amazing as that is the film has just so much else going for it. Nearly all the characters are hatching their own little schemes to move ahead & none of them feel particularly sympathetic.

1oz0m20,Did anyone else prefer Tim Burton’s Sleepy Hollow and dislike the original story?,5xzpljuj,ardouronerous,movies,18,0.61,22,1763335633.0,2025-11-17 00:27:13,True,"

I’m curious if anyone else has had a similar experience with Tim Burton’s Sleepy Hollow (1999). I first saw the film when I was 14, and I absolutely loved it. At the time, I had never read Washington Irving’s original Sleepy Hollow nor have I seen Disney’s Sleepy Hollow, and when I finally read the original story in my local library and watching the Disney 1949 animated version, I was kind of confused, Ichabod’s portrayal in the original story and Disney version really threw me off. In the original story, Ichabod is depicted as a superstitious and somewhat unlikable schoolteacher who tried to marry Katrina for her money, whose greed and ambition lead to his downfall, so seeing Ichabod like this instead of the sympathetic, heroic figure from Burton’s version was jarring. I didn’t enjoy seeing him as the ""bad guy"".

Tim Burton reimagines Ichabod as a detective, blending Sherlock Holmes-like intellect with 18th century mysticism. The film’s atmosphere, the score by Danny Elfman, and the overall visual style were all captivating, and I found Depp’s portrayal of Ichabod very compelling. I loved how Burton’s Sleepy Hollow leaned into mystery, and the clash between reason and superstition.

I totally get that Burton’s Sleepy Hollow isn’t a faithful retelling, it’s more of a gothic reimagining that expands on the original story.

I’m curious if anyone else has gone through something similar?

Taxi Driver — Can we talk about the ending? [SPOILERS]

I can't believe I'd never seen this movie before. I had the opportunity to see it in theaters for the first time last night, so I knew I had to take it.

I haven't been that engaged in a theater film in what feels like... well, probably never. Relating to (and then being horrified at) Travis, seeing the irony of his vigilante methods, the wonderful way the city (I just spent the Summer in) was shot and presented.

Anyways, the ending.

I'd heard the interpretations before. That it was Travis's 'dreamlike-state' as he died, a juxtaposition of a happy ending right after the horror that was the shooting (which might be my favorite """"action"""" scene I've ever seen in a film yet for reasons I could go on and on about, but if anything, the use of audio in the scene).

Then I saw that Word of God rejects this interpretation, and that instead, the ending was intended to further reinforce the feelings that society has towards a vigilante—that is, Travis, the man who was just trying to assassinate a Presidential hopeful; Travis, the man who tried to blow his own brains out in front of Iris; Travis, the hero.

Now, I do see Ebert's POV on this pretty well:

>There has been much discussion about the ending, in which we see newspaper clippings about Travis' ""heroism,"" and then Betsy gets into his cab and seems to give him admiration instead of her earlier disgust. Is this a fantasy scene? Did Travis survive the shoot-out? Are we experiencing his dying thoughts? Can the sequence be accepted as literally true?

>I am not sure there can be an answer to these questions. The end sequence plays like music, not drama: It completes the story on an emotional, not a literal, level. We end not on carnage but on redemption, which is the goal of so many of Scorsese's characters. They despise themselves, they live in sin, they occupy mean streets, but they want to be forgiven and admired. Whether Travis gains that status in reality or only in his mind is not the point; throughout the film, his mental state has shaped his reality, and at last, in some way, it has brought him a kind of peace.

When the film ended, I absolutely could not see any other interpretation than ""this doesn't actually happen,"" for several reasons:

1. Travis sits in the chair post-shooting, and holds briefly before the camera cuts to the surreal apartment flythrough. This is the cut from reality to Travis's own mind.

2. The letter from Iris's parents is read in a monotone, slow voice—the same way that Travis has read his own writings throughout much of the film, and the same way that he might imagine his screwed-up ideals of a 'happy ending': Iris is back with her (possibly abusive) family, despite being scarred from witnessing Travis blow a man's brains out.

3. The newspaper clippings themselves are something Travis would fantasize about, rather than would actually exist—all of them present an extremely dark murder scene as though it was an act of heroism. While I know NYC is known for having supported vigilantes (""He who takes, Goetz""), I don't think the law could see this as being the same way.

4. Travis is back to looking like his old self. Identical to his old self. His hair is absolutely identical to what it was at the beginning of the film. The entire post-clippings scene is presented in a location and feeling so far removed from the rest of the film's realistic locale-centric style.

5. Betsy gets in the cab. That's pretty surreal to begin with, not to mention the manner in which she stares into Travis's mirror the entire trip. Travis is recalling an idealized version of her, something he craved and desired. There's no reason for her to actually see him as a hero.

Regardless, I do still see Ebert's view that ""it doesn't matter,"" and I do see that ""THE ENDING WAS ALL A DREAM!"" is rather silly nowadays, but it's such a perfect setup for that approach I really couldn't believe that it has been rejected.

Anyways, I just wanted a chance to talk about this fucking amazing movie.",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ozzlbe/has_anybody_read_the_newspaper_clippings_on/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ozzlbe/has_anybody_read_the_newspaper_clippings_on/,Discussion,False,False,False,False,2025-11-18,3,Tuesday

I've been doing a retrospective of the Academy Awards with my analysis alternating between analyzing historical films while also poking fun at the Hollywood establishment. In this month's review, we check out the Rodgers & Hammerstein classic, The Sound of Music. While a classic, it may surprise you to learn that it was actually not immediately seen as such by some of the snootier critics of the day.

This ties into part 2 where we compare it to an inflection point between movies that were a part of upcoming artistic New Wave versus the big-budget epics that Hollywood kept putting all their chips on. Movies include one of Roman Polanski's first films, an undeserved Best Actor win and the first movie to feature on-screen nudity in one half and two classic comedic epics, a hilariously inaccurate WWII adventure and the great Russian romance Doctor Zhivago in the other. Hope you enjoy and feel free to forward to anyone else that you think might find it interesting.

1oztpss,What are your favorite movies by Jane Campion and explain why?,1i5hxitczs,LaserDiscCurious,movies,0,0.32,1,1763416620.0,2025-11-17 22:57:00,True,"There are two movies from Jane Campion I absolutely adore and it's ""An Angel at My Table"" and ""Sweetie"". 

I think I relate to the outsider messaging in both these movies. Women who struggle to live their lives in a unconventional manner and become constricted by it when society judges them for it. 

An Angel at my Table gave me so much anxiety. Janet Frame (a incredible Kerry Fox) starts out as a seemingly normal child until she grows up and starts to show signs of depression which end up being mistaken by schizophrenia which causes her to be hospitalized for various years. It's a heartbreaking movie in some ways, the inability and frustration to express yourself because you're so shy and repressed as well. I vividly remember the scene of Janet going outside and ripping her clothes off as she's frustrated by her shyness and fear of facing people, I related to that. Very memorable movie for me. It's also uplifting. 

""Sweetie"" is a awkward movie but in a good way. There are two protagonists, the title character (played by Genevieve Lemon) and her sister, Kay (a terrific Karen Colston). Sweetie is wild and outgoing but erratic and clearly suffers of a mental illness which gets worse. Kay is the rational sister and yet, she's odd. Eccentric and self-destructive, she tries to keep her family together while resenting Sweetie for being the favorite. There are a couple of disturbing scenes which are left unresolved and you're expected to judge for yourself as a viewer which I appreciated. It's a drama that is occasionally funny until you realize that under that humor there's a lot of tragedy. I don't think Jane Campion has ever made a movie like this again. It's also completely unpredictable so go in blind. I liked the surrealness of it all, the sunny colors and how you never know what will happen next, but I also found the movie very sad.

My local theater has been doing rereleases since COVID pretty regularly, but my question for discussion is why don't we see a bigger push to re-release classic films? Instead of spending the millions of dollars to remake a movie shot-for-shot, why not ramp up to a big theater event? There's precedence for it, the Disney Vault, remove the movie from streaming or physical release in the year or two prior and the theater release is the re-introduction. Movies have done this for years before home media. Gone with the Wind is the highest grossing movie ever and was released 10 times in theaters since is premiere in 1939.

I would think this would be mutually beneficial for studios and theaters, gives life to old movies, hits the nostalgia factor, and makes money on a popular IP without having to pay for production cost again.

>!But he survives, and while he’s trying to make it back home, he ends up teaming up with this injured wolf he later calls Alpha. Watching the two of them trying to survive together was honestly way better than I expected.!<

Charles Dance put it very well here:

""I've done some appalling films. Junk is absolutely the right word. You do what you can with the stuff you're given. It's a misconception that actors make choices. For all but the most privileged few, the only choice is to work or not to work.""

But there's a difference between actors who take those paycheck roles in lackluster or bad films and give it their all or chew up the scenery in entertaining fashion and those who clearly are not even trying. See the 2000 ""Dungeons & Dragons"", a terrible film where you have at one end Thora Birch monotonously droning every line and putting in as little effort as possible and at the other end Jeremy Irons (who openly admitted to doing this to pay for his newly acquired castle) tearing through every scene he's in like a mako shark on a cocaine high. You can't get a better example of the extremes of this.

My personal favorite example of the ""don't care"" approach is Peter O'Toole in the adaptation of Dean Koontz's ""Phantoms."" Not a bad movie (Affleck is the bomb in it), but one that got a very negative reaction upon release and one you definitely don't expect the likes of O'Toole being in it. Being O'Toole, he isn't bad, but he's obviously putting in minimal effort and his attitude screams, ""Look, I had a bar tab to pay off, sue me."" It's something I find very entertaining.

I personally feel like it's one big art piece. Like it's a romantic cautionary tale of what can happen when you focus and chasing an unfulfilling/empty dream caused by never paying attention to right now. Like the director believes this type of romance is like a never ending want for more. A warning against the inherent narcissistic control shown by both characters. I believe the Movie director shows this with the overly coloured/bright/idealized/romantic/perfect and rose tinted style to portray the MC's Perception of the world.  
    
I think the show is intentionally a big nothing burger. It's nostalgia ice cream with rose tinted cherries on top which hid their consequences relating to their selves and the others surrounding them.   
Then turn all the dazzling lights so bright, by the end of the movie you forget the real doubts and distrust that formed and broke their relationship. That leads to the unlearned lesson of Mia's (Emma Watson) at the movies end.  
  
The two romantic character's ignored the disappointing real world and the imperfections between themselves. Trying to live with an imperfect person while you're imagining an illusion of perfection a poor foundation for their love which led to their relationship breaking and them splitting.

But it just seems so not what I would have expected for him.  I don't think today he is a director whose name will draw an audience like so many auteur types, yet he does seem like an auteur director....sometimes.  He's also just super talented.  There's no reason he shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath as Tarantino, Spielberg or Nolan.  But unlike those three, a ""The Next Film from...."" tagline on a poster isn't going to instantly sell out movie theaters.

I think maybe it's easy to point to Spy Kids and the Lavagirl thing and be like, ""Oh, he just wanted to make kid-friendly blockbusters"" or whatever, but it doesn't seem like that's the case because he still did Grindhouse, Machete and Sin City through all that too.  Also, Hypnotic was apparently a recent film of his but nobody saw it, and that's what I'm getting at.  I think Tarantino could do a string of kid movies and as soon as he comes back with a ""real movie"", everyone's going to want to see it.

So what's going on with Rodriguez?  Why didn't he reach that level of status and fame?

I’ve seen all but two of his movies, Magnolia and Hard Eight. I’ve enjoyed most of the ones I’ve seen, but I wouldn’t say I love any of them. 

I’d always heard that PDL is one of his best, so I decided to give it a try. My biggest issue with most of his movies has always been on the emotional side. He is technically a great director, but I’ve never cared whatsoever about a single character from his films. Everything I’d ever read or heard about this one made me think that this could be the one to break that cycle.

Sadly, that didn’t happen. If anything, this might be second to last on my PTA ranking after Licorice Pizza.

First of all, the things I liked… it was pretty. All his movies are. And it was stressful, which I think is what it was going for.

But the main issue with this movie for me is the romance at the core. I’ve seen so many people say how sweet this movie is, how it’s one of the best romance movies of this century, and I just don’t get it.

Aside from one awkward interaction at the start, we don’t get any scenes with Barry and Lena until more than 30 minutes into the movie. And there is absolutely no chemistry between them. Their scenes are thinly written. The movie never shows their romance develop. It just tells you that it did.

I know Barry is supposed to be an awkward weirdo, but so is almost everybody in the movie. No one talks like normal people, except maybe Luis Guzman’s character. So there’s no real contrast with Barry and everyone else.

It needed to spend more time developing the romance and less time indulging in off-putting weirdo nonsense.

* Successful career woman from a big city goes back to her home town
* Reunites with her ex and her friends from her past
* Rekindles feelings for her ex
* A career driven fiancé follows her to her home town
* She chooses to leave her fiancé for her ex during a big event
* Fiancé wishes her well in the end

Probably the only thing missing is snow and Christmas.

\----

I then asked AI ""*what are the cliches of a hallmark movie*""

  
Plot and character cliches

* **Big-city professional returns home:** A career-focused person from a big city returns to their small hometown, often for the holidays, to find they can't go back to their old life. - **CHECK**



* **Failing family business:** The protagonist must save a beloved but failing small-town business, such as a bakery, bookstore, or inn, with the help of a love interest. - OK, maybe there's no failing family business.



* **High school sweethearts reuniting:** The main couple knew each other in high school, and the plot revolves around them reconnecting and realizing they are meant to be together. - **CHECK**



* **""Meet-cute"" in the snow:** The couple's first meeting is often a clumsy or romantic encounter, frequently happening during a snowy day or other winter event. - Well, if we're counting their reunion when Mel went to Jake to have the divorce papers signed a meet-cute... No? Alright... Well, like I said, it's missing snow...



* **The grand romantic gesture:** A dramatic chase or a public declaration of love is often the climax, especially in the final act. - **CHECK**



* **Misunderstandings and secrets:** A misunderstanding, a secret, or a misinterpreted action often drives the conflict and keeps the couple from getting together until the very end. - **CHECK**



* **Career vs. family dilemma:** The female lead is often faced with a choice between her career and her new relationship or family in the hometown. - **CHECK,** well, maybe more like her fiancé's career vs family.

Let's also add the below cliches:

* **Charming small towns:** The setting is almost always a picturesque, idyllic small town, which may have a festive or seasonal name. - **CHECK,** Pigeon Creek seems nice



* **Predictable happy ending:** All Hallmark movies, especially romantic ones, are guaranteed to end happily, with the couple getting together. - **CHECK,** If you didn't think she'd end up with Jake after the glass store/restaurant/resort scene, then you probably did not watch enough movies around that time.



* **Finding love at home:** The main character often discovers that ""all they've ever wanted has been here all along"" in their hometown.  - **CHECK**

That's 8/10.

Realistic portrayals of battles can be interesting when done well, but most directors prefer to go for spectacle.

The most notable example of this would be 300. They occasionally pay lip service to the importance of military formations, but in practice the Spartans just go out and fight on their own like badasses who each can take on dozens of Persians all on their own.

The Lord of the Rings movies also often rely on rule of cool for their battle scenes, especially with anything involving Legolas.

It is also quite common in superhero movies. Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame both end with large armies just charging towards each other and fighting in melee combat, with minimal use of vehicles or long-ranged weaponry.

Two films that I think that epitomize what I'm talking about, are Mission Impossible (1996) directed by Brian De Palma and Ocean's Eleven (2001) directed by Steven Soderbergh. Both De Palma and Soderbergh had earned acclaim making smaller budgeted films and in each case they had access to a larger budget and more studio resources. In each film you can see the director's indie roots. The shots are much more creative and simply look better (the opening scene to Mission Impossible really shows off De Palma's talent) and they take certain risks that standard blockbuster directors wouldn't take. In short when blockbusters are made by auteur directors you get an indie studio style film with a big studio budget. What are some other examples of these types of films?",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1oy1p6r/best_examples_of_blockbusters_directed_by_auteur/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1oy1p6r/best_examples_of_blockbusters_directed_by_auteur/,Discussion,False,False,False,False,2025-11-15,21,Saturday
1oz6gpd,In Cape Fear (1991) would Max Cady have been a better villain if he was actually innocent of the crime he went to prison for?,3685y0on,heeheejones,movies,0,0.29,16,1763352131.0,2025-11-17 05:02:11,True,"I recently watched Cape Fear over the weekend and must admit that I enjoyed the movie thoroughly. The cast was excellent and Robert DeNiro's portrayal of the villainous Max Cady was both compelling and ominous in equal measure. 

One thing that stood out to me was why Cady was out for revenge against Sam Bowden. Sam, who was acting as Cady's public defender had buried evidence of Cady's victims ""promiscuity"" in order to ensure that he would receive a lighter sentence or be exonerated. It is heavily implied that Cady did indeed commit the crimes he was accused of and its also mentioned that he bragged about beating two prior aggravated rape charges as well.

While I did enjoy this plot about Sam failing in his duties as a lawyer to achieve what he perceived as a morally just outcome, I was wondering if it would have been better if Cady was actually innocent of the one crime he actually went to jail for. 

Now I'm not saying that he should be portrayed as a justifiably wronged man but rather an evil, menace who was ironically punished the one time he actually didn't do something wrong. 

Perhaps there could be a flashback of Sam and Cady's first meeting 14 years ago. At the time, Cady is far more brash and less intelligent. Sam who is initially doing right by his job as a lawyer is soon repulsed when Cady says something like ""If I can walk for the ones I actually did, it's gonna be easy to be the one I didn't do.""

Cady brags to Sam about his past crimes and Sam, who at the time would have been a new father to a young daughter, deliberately sabotages the case to ensure that Cady goes to prison. In a way, Sam is ensuring in a flawed but somewhat noble way, that Cady receives punishment for the crimes he believes he has gotten away with.

I feel like by doing this, it would also explain Cady's development in prison and the seriousness of his grudge against Sam. We see that Cady becomes well-read and very intelligent in prison and obtains a small inheritance upon coming out. His brush with Sam has taught him to put on a more charming facade, be less brash but still hold a deep vendetta that despite his newfound education, he refuses to solve through legal means.

If Cady really wanted, he could have ruined Sam's life and reputation through proper channels but he chose to do it in the worst, most psychotic way possible. Sam purposely ensuring he goes to prison even if he did not commit the crime he was accused of justifies this course of action perfectly.

Personally, if I somehow could re-touch the script, I would portray Cady as a man who was able to argue for his own release and comes out of prison and exonerated man who publicly forgives Sam but torments him when nobody else is looking.

What do you guys think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1oz6gpd/in_cape_fear_1991_would_max_cady_have_been_a/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1oz6gpd/in_cape_fear_1991_would_max_cady_have_been_a/,Discussion,False,False,True,False,2025-11-17,5,Monday

Cut to him riding a bike / motorcycle along a sloping embankment or a raceway-type slope (very striking visual).

He is a cutthroat ambitious man and pursues  a wealthy heiress / business family daughter(in-law?) who he probably meets in a bar and leaves the co-tenant for her.

They also have a get together on a boat in a lake.

1oyzet2,In Defense of Saturday Night Fever (and why it is superior to John Travolta's other musical film Grease),95pf8t6s,Forward-Carry5993,movies,0,0.4,54,1763332621.0,2025-11-16 23:37:01,True,"Hello fellow movie fans! I wanted to share a thought of mine and to hear your thoughts. I have thought about John Travolta's career in musical films. The two major films he will be remembered for are 1977's Saturday Night Fever and 1978's Grease. However, it is clear that Grease remains more popular, with reunions, re-releases, a sing-a-long edition, and consistent  Broadway productions. Saturday Night Fever on the other hand, is less recognizable to the general audience with many only knowing the movie from the Bee Gees's Stayin Aive intro and the iconic poster of Travolta doing a disco pose and possibly the Airplane movie parody scene.

I think when comparing the two and especially weighing in which film is better for teenagers to view, Saturday Night Fever is the superior film.

My reasons are as follows:

Grease is a nostalgic-bait view of the 1950s where times seem to be simpler. This is a pretty common trend where media of a generation portrays a story in earlier years as less troublesome. Grease's world is one where white students are the main cast, no allusions to racial discrimination is an issue, rampant sexism is not treated as seriously, and other social issues are not shown. When Danny attempts to rape Sandy, the movie never focuses on Sandy's reaction to be retreating from this event and instead focuses on Danny's song about how much h wants to be true. The final ending of the movie has Sandy change for Danny rather than Danny changing for her.

The 1950's contrary to popular conception, were not a easy-going period. The cold war, poverty, racism, sexism, worries about crime, the red scare, decolonization, rise of pan-Arabism, homosexuality, etc were concerns the country had. To many people today, it may shock you that the 1950s did not have Medicaid or Medicare. The 1950s also saw thousands of Americans out of high school/college die in Korea. Its clear Grease (the movie), was made to present a comforting popularized version of the 1950s to the ww2 generation and the younger generation born out from the 1960s of a ""better past.""

Saturday Night Fever on the other hand encapsulates more accurately the real-life issues of the 1970s in inner city America. Our characters are working class, trying to survive in a decaying capitalist America where inflation and a lack of jobs are worsening their living situations. More Americans and especially teenagers will face this problem as they grow up; alienation.

Tony, and his male friends, are rapists who never receive their due punishment. Unlike Grease, and more importantly for impressionable movie goers, the film NEVER downplays the horrible events. We SEE the fear and damage the women suffer. We are revolted when John's character, Tony, shames Annette for being raped under the influence of drugs. What is worse is that, in real life, this is too common. I seriously am reminded of Eight Grade's story.

Unlike Grease, the ending to Saturday Night Fever, gives a more ambiguous and bittersweet ending. Tony promises to Stephanie that he only wants to be friends and that he wants to better himself. It's honestly a more positive look at masculinity than anything Grease ever showed and forces us to think at what it means to be break away from a social group that upholds sexism.

And its not like sexism is only confined to women. We see how tony and his friends nearly attack a gay couple while walking in the city. Again, this is accurate to the time period and is still an issue today. Racism is also tackled with Tony and his friends attacking a Puerto Rican gang for an alleged assault on their friend and racism at the dance club competition.

While Saturday Night Fever has been rightfully criticized for whitewashing the real-life disco scene, its strengths I believe overcome its problems.

Plus, if Saturday Night Fever is criticized for misrepresenting history, then why is not Grease?

\*As a sidenote, I believe Grease 2 actually may be better than Grease because it similarly has a better message about gender roles than Grease.",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1oyzet2/in_defense_of_saturday_night_fever_and_why_it_is/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1oyzet2/in_defense_of_saturday_night_fever_and_why_it_is/,Discussion,False,False,False,False,2025-11-16,23,Sunday

American here, supporter of the armed forces, war/history enthusiast (as much as one can be enthusiastic about war in the sense), and therefore a connoisseur of war movies. Currently watching Hacksaw Ridge (2016) and there are a lot of scenes glorifying the killing of Japanese troops, for obvious reasons.

It got me thinking, I've never heard of or seen any films or TV shows with a flipped script, real or fictional. Obviously most American war movies will show glory from the victors (American revolution, WWI, WWII, Vietnam, various middle east conflicts but also fictional like either of the Red Dawn films. This extends to video games and non-war movies, like most Die Hard films feature Germans and Russians as villains. Even franchises like John Wick aren't necessarily nationality-driven, but based in NY, a number of bad guys are soviet.

I'm certain foreign films may have a film that takes place in say, Russia, and Americans are antagonists. Best I could think of is Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) but it's been like 15 years since I saw it, and don't actually remember it.

1oyv6jy,Snow White 90th Anniversary in 2027. More Classic Reissues of Disney / 20th Titles Possible?,20oavkql,rwinger24,movies,0,0.3,8,1763322482.0,2025-11-16 20:48:02,True,"2027 will mark the 90th anniversary of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

As it got a 4K restoration not too long ago, Disney should take the opportunity to reissue this classic masterpiece in theaters for 1-2 weeks only.

Their release schedule is focused on huge brand tentpoles. But I do hope they have room to release it in theaters close to the milestone.

As of now, March, September or October of 2027 are the only open slots to possibly reissue the movie. They could partner with Fathom Entertainment if it is not a huge priority. Maybe they can attach the Silly Symphony, The Old Mill, which is the first time the multiplane camera got put to use.

2027 will also be the first official year after Bob Iger steps down as CEO. Alan Bergman should open up to the idea of a classic animated re-release which will be the first time we have seen this in theaters since the first digital restoration in 1993.

I hope this can kickstart a new revenue stream by reissuing more of these traditionally animated masterpieces to ignite a re-interest in 2D animation across the theatrical mainstream. Not to mention there are also several legacy 20th Century Fox films not much in circulation or licensed out to arthouse theaters for special events since 2019. Fox has several movies in the Disney vault that are worth getting restored from the Shirley Temple movies, the Marilyn Monroe movies, and many more that has been licensed to TCM for broadcast.

Cinderella also got a 4K restoration and they can release that in theaters too.

And after the live action remake flopped in theaters and opened to mixed-negative reviews, I wish this will be how they apologize to their audience and start honoring their classic library more.

What would you like to see Disney do for the Snow White 90th anniversary? And could we see more classic Disney / Fox titles released in theaters after Fathom reissued The Sound of Music?

1oyq00d,Haunt(2019 is one of the dumbest horror movies humanity has ever seen.,muv59ggl,Neither-Spell-626,movies,0,0.41,3,1763310379.0,2025-11-16 17:26:19,True,"**The characters in this movie were making terrible choices pretty much the whole time, even by horror movie standards. Even the villains stopped making smart moves in the last act!**



**Everything is so banal and predictable. The film has its share of dull moments; apparently, the writers aren't particularly bright when it comes to adequately describing the characters' actions. It seems okay at first, but then they screw it up.**



Abusive ex (which so conveniently related to her trauma) is foreshadowed to be the bad guy.



After the party in the alley this creepy tall figure is stalking her. (I assumed this was boyfriend). Plot twist it’s some random dude that likes killing.



They’re followed and the only one who mentions it is Harper. Friend who cared about her and her boyfriend issues magically couldn’t care when she says “Yo pull over we’re being followed”.



All her friends are crap. Doesn’t add much to my rant but damn. They are lackluster.



They end up magically spotting a haunted house on the road they were followed on. Why were they followed if the killers knew they were going to go there? What if they decided to go to the other party instead? Where did the random girl behind plexi glass come from? Didn’t the chunky guy have a flyer from the party? Why are they presumably the second or only ones there?



The forms were handed out before they went in. Just because some yahoo gives you a form doesn’t mean you jot your real name, number, address, and apparently parents address???? I could see a waiver for a really big fancy haunted house that’s very well known and popular where there’s interactive actors but this random warehouse with one guy that says Jack squat is enough to just roll with I guess.



I wonder, what if someone had two phones with them, but gave one away and hid the other? Would that work? I don't think the clown would have a metal detector, lol.



One of the killers hiding his shoes under his cloak seemed like a setup for something more significant, but it never paid off. Like what the hell was this all about? It seemed to foreshadow some potential connection between the killer and the friends or that the shoes would be used later to identify him. Instead, we get a detail introduced with zero purpose.



The origin of the first girl branded by the witch was unclear. Did the killers just finish butchering another group of teens, or do they keep victims caged up for future events? Big questions about the continuity of the killers’ operation here.



Fast forward after they figure out it’s all real you end up questioning every single decision these people make. “Hey we got a weapon and this guy cornered. Let’s follow him he seems trustworthy”. Proceeds to split up because there’s apparently zero strength in numbers.



It's amazing how quickly the characters forgot that they could all crawl back through the tunnel together, rather than one at a time, as Mitch said.



Why didn't Evan wait for Mitch and the rest of the gang typically allowing Mitch to get a hammer and seal the tunnel.



When the clown has taken all of the phones, he chooses not to put Harper's phone in the microwave. While it could just be a coincidence, I think it is odd. Perhaps he was looking specifically for her phone.



Nathan grabs Harpers phone and texts the location to her ex? Everyone’s phones were locked why not hers? No 911? Not taking Harper's phone? Trust that Jack ass McGhee is gonna save the day without the help of the police?

  
Sam was totally absolutely useless and irrelevant with his irrational thinking outside of providing them a vehicle at the end. Wouldn't you call the police after getting sent help in caps and finding the location to be in the middle of no where.



He’s absent the entire movie except for when he receives an alarming text message saying HELP and a location, to which he drives to and finds a super sketchy warehouse. He then casually walks into the creepy warehouse where his Gf has just texted HELP from and decides to shout around and ask the nice looking guys in there for directions. He immediately dies, not even getting a chance to fight back, having spent about 120 seconds on screen.



The unlocked phone he had before the clown kills him would have been some sort of saving grace to the idea of this guy being there but it was just filler. It’s like the writers forgot about him and they already filmed half the movie. Oh but take the truck he drove that’s why he was a main plot point I suppose. Oh and let’s reiterate Harpers trauma. He was just a red herring. We were to assume he'd save her, but instead got killed.



It irked me to no end that Sam was written to be such a demented asshole that he left his car parked, with its door open and the keys inside, in the middle of the road because he was just so blinded by his rage and need to control Harper (read: the writers didn’t know how else to get our heroes in a car at the end).



Why the hell would this elaborate haunted house not only be made for this small group of college kids? Why would this elaborate setup include live rounds scattered all over anyway? I guess it just makes sense.



Harper takes the wounded Nathan to the hospital, and police officers and paramedics are driving towards them. Who called them?



If the police arrive at that house, I don't think there will be any investigation, since the clown set everything on fire to hide the evidence.



Conclusion: A silly, boring, forgettable film with silly characters, silly and pointless “maniacs,” silly murders of the main characters, and so on. There are no screamers, no scary moments, no gore.

https://www.bafta.org/media-centre/press-releases/a-life-in-pictures-christopher-nolan/

>His colour palettes have been influenced by his red-green color blindness.

>CN: Well I left the purple up to other people because I’m colour-blind

>EB: Not your colour?!.. [Laughs}

>CN: No, I can barely see shades of purple, I’m red-green colour-blind, uh so I left that aspect up to Lindy very much. Um, but no it was a tremendous thing to be involved with because Heath didn’t do many films and he would wait a long time between films, as he put it to me he would wait until he felt he needed to go out and do something else, like he really would wait until he was hungry.



I had no idea about this but it makes a lot of sense for why his films look the way they do - not that I care either way since I find the grey-blue colors and the orange with Oppenheimer quite appealing - but there's an explanation for it beyond just him finding it ""aesthetically pleasing"". It's basically just his natural inclincation. Today I Learned I guess. 

Also a really interesting excerpt from his Memento book about how this influences his movies:


>""It came up while he was filming Memento, in conversation with Guy Pearce, by way of illustrating why everyone seems to take advantage of poor Leonard Shelby's condition. ""If you tell someone you're color-blind, the first thing they do is they show you something and say, 'What color is that?' If you were in a wheelchair, people wouldn't go, 'Oh, you're in a wheelchair. Can you stand up?' It's a bizarre response, but they're fasci- nated because they can't understand that you would see things differently. So they immediately start asking you what do things look like, and then laughing at you as you get it wrong. You see it with Mark Boone Junior's character, the motel clerk, where he's just fascinated by it. As soon as he tells people he can't remember things, then they start to test his memory. It seems cruel. People are fascinated by other people's perception of the world and the way in which it differs. I've always been interested in the tension between the subjective point of view and our faith in an objective reality. In Memento, we dealt with that enormously, particularly at the end, but I think that is in all my films. Whenever I am making a film, I'm constantly being reminded of the paradox of reconciling our subjective views of the world with our deep-seated belief or feeling that there is an objective real- ity outside that is fundamentally unknowable. We can't step outside our own heads-we just can't.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1owwmcx/just_realised_that_christopher_nolans_color/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1owwmcx/just_realised_that_christopher_nolans_color/,Discussion,False,False,False,False,2025-11-14,14,Friday

1oy6yv0,A Movie Trope I Love: Reaching the Edge of the Known World and Going Beyond,ywy6v,BoreusSimius,movies,3,0.64,10,1763251381.0,2025-11-16 01:03:01,True,"So, I didn't know which sub would be the best fit for this post because it's more about storytelling in general, but certainly in movies.

Call it a trope, or concept or whatever, but I love it when in a story we see the characters reach the edge of what they thought was the whole world until that point and then go beyond it. Maybe it just activates this innate desire to explore in me, but everytime a movie, show, etc does it, it really captivates me.

I just finished watching The Truman Show again, and that film has a brilliant example of this. When Truman finally reaches the wall with the fake painted horizon on it and breaks through. When he steps through that exit door, even though I know it's just a mundane normal world out there, part of me is desperate to see him explore it.

I think the first example of this phenomenon I remember noticing was in The Land Before Time II. The first film is a masterpiece, the rest are not, I'll get that out the way, but the second film did present one of these moments for me, and it might have been the first. The first film has the characters end up in the Great Valley, seemingly the last lush and verdant land left in the otherwise ruined world, encircled and hidden by a ring of mountains. Well the second film has the protagonists venture beyond into the inhospitable outside world, and I remember this being so interesting to me. The idea of this vast, unknown outside world, and seeing just glimpses of it. 

The other big example I think of isn't a film, but Attack on Titan has it at the core of it's story. For most of the show, we and the characters are led to believe thst what's left of the world is just one collection of walled cities. There's nothing left outside, just danger. Then, we eventually get to the point where we realize the world is so much larger. There's that famous scene of Eren looking out to the sea, which is a perfect scene in my opinion. That moment encapsulates concept I'm talking about so well. 

I'm sure there are plenty of other examples, but these are three that stuck out to me. 

Bare with me when I say this, but the whole ""Flat Earth"" concept kind of fits this too. Now it's nonsense of course, but I can sort of see why some people would latch onto the idea. If it weren't rooted in nonsensical conspiracy theories, the concept would actually make for a really cool fantasy world. The whole idea of there being more world beyond a giant ice wall is great world building, but alas sort of tainted now.

Anyway, I hope this post fits in in this sub, it was a film that inspired it. I'd be interested to see if anyone feels the same, or has any examples of their own.

1oy3622,I’m I the only one who feels “Fantastic Racism” is overused?,de84fqa,Luppercus,movies,0,0.3,21,1763241403.0,2025-11-15 22:16:43,True," 

For those who don’t know, the Fantastic Racism trope is when a setting has discrimination against non-existing fantasy creatures.

 

I was recently watching “The Happytime Murders”, an adult comedy movie about puppets and humans co-existing and one puppet detective investigating a series of murders. In the movie is clearly established right away that the puppets are second-class citizens and discriminated against. Thing is… this has no baring at all in the plot. The whole plot could have be just the same if you retire the element of anti-puppet racism in the setting. The only reason is there I think is because writers probably thought “it should”. Like is the default situation, in a setting with humans and non-humans interacting the non-humans have to be discriminated. There’s “no way” this couldn’t happen either because “won’t be realistic” or “that’s the way is always written”. I notice that this mindset also permeates movies with terrible worldbuilding like “The Electric State” and “Bright”.

 

And don’t get me wrong, sometimes is necessary. Movies like Roger Rabbit, Disctrict 9 or the X-Men franchise need it, the plot couldn’t work without it.

 

But others don’t. One thing I liked about the “Rescue Rangers” movie is that they deal away with the Fantastic Racism. At no point in the movie is shown toons are discriminated, in fact some are in positions of power or are clearly rich. Which is fine, it wasn’t needed for the plot and they didn’t use it. Same can be said about one TV show I really like which is “The Legend of Vox Machina”.

 

But maybe is just me. Opinions?",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1oy3622/im_i_the_only_one_who_feels_fantastic_racism_is/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1oy3622/im_i_the_only_one_who_feels_fantastic_racism_is/,Discussion,False,False,False,False,2025-11-15,22,Saturday

Anyways, the formula is quite simple: Follow the source material, stop injecting your own ways of thinking into things that are the opposite of what the show or movie is trying to present, and everything will be fine. For example, look at Dune 2, the new demon slayer animated movie, old game of thrones, the OG lord of the rings movies or even the new one piece live action anime adaptation. They FOLLOWED THE SOURCE MATERIAL and wow, the audience enjoyed the movies and shows, what a surprise. I don't understand why or how a studio would not just follow this simple concept, because don't these billion dollar corporations ENJOY making money? Follow the source material = more money. It's an EXTREMELY simple concept that I have seen butchered recently over, and over, and over again, and I just wanted to see if anyone else has felt similar frustration recently.

If you want to make it more film-specific, there's also the Demon Knight and Bordello Of Blood movies along with the excellent 1972 anthology film and it's often overlooked sequel, The Vault Of Horror.

TFTC terrified me as a kid largely due to the Crypt Keeper, and I suspect he was a childhood boogeyman for countless Millennials back in the day. As an adult I truly appreciate and enjoy it's brilliant mix of macabre Horror and gore with it's dark humor. It was also impressive with the high-quality production values and the A-list talent it attracted between the directors and actors.

Some of my absolute favorite episodes:

* Television Terror
* House Of Horror
* Undertaking Palor
* Fitting Punishment
* The New Arrival
* Mournin' Mess
* The Man Who Was Death
* Abra Cadaver
* Korman's Kalamity
* Cutting Cards
* Dig That Cat... He's Real Gone
* Creep Course
* People Who Live In Brass Hearses
* Easel Kill Ya
* Strung Along
* Comes The Dawn


On the subject of the movies, I've always been a fan of the 1972 anthology film from Amicus and it's sequel is quite enjoyable, too. Demon Knight is among my favorite 90s Horror films, and it's a shame Bordello Of Blood was such a weak follow-up. The troubled production history behind BOB is more fascinating and entertaining than the film itself and it's a wonder the film ever saw the light of day. It's still so unfortunate with the messy legal battles the TFTC IP has been caught up in for years by now that may sadly never be resolved.",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ox7ej2/tales_from_the_crypt/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ox7ej2/tales_from_the_crypt/,Discussion,False,False,False,False,2025-11-14,21,Friday

Most obviously, in a decade filled with action and romance movies, a 3-hour-long biopic on who is considered by many to be the best musician of all time was obviously gonna stand out.

After watching the movie... of course, I could talk about how great the music choice was (clearly), how great the performances of F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce are, how the hairstyles of Mozart and Constanze without the wigs (or the pool table, for some reason?) kinda break the immersion of this being set 200 years prior to its release, or how odd it is that no one in the cast got nearly as big roles for the rest of their careers.

But there is something else that struck me about this movie...

A sense of ambition.

Not just ""ambition"", but a very certain type of ambition; one which is an astonishing rarity in Hollywood.

One, of which the only other example in Hollywood's somewhat recent memory is the LOTR trilogy. And yes, I know it's utterly ridiculous to compare nearly anything to LOTR ^((it isn't, by the way; but that's far too hard a pill for y'all to swallow)) ...

But there are very, very few works in live-action in general which really feel like the actors devoted to them not just a handful of moths of their time, but their whole lives. Really, that is how all the performances and everything else comes off.

It is *that* very sense of ambition that many people probably refer to when they make the utterly pretentious statement that nothing like LOTR will ever get made again.

1. It as far as I remember wasn’t a new movie out, because it was on one of the normal Freeview channels, so it had to be at least a year old. Personally, I think it was probably from 80s or 90s latest early 2000s. 
2. Definitely an adult movie, or ment for adults, would definitely say it had horror vibes. Definitely had some sort of mention and hints of paranormal things. So age rating was definitely at least a 15. 
3. Was definitely in English and I don’t remember it being dubbed so it was probably A British or American movie. 
4. The main scene that I remember is either sisters or best friends are sorting some stuff out at a house like packing boxes and one hears something or goes into the attic for some reason and the next time we see her she has scratches all over her face, and she looks like she’s dead, and she’s also seen at the end sitting in a wheelchair type thing with her eyes closed and then suddenly her eyes open and the screen goes black. The movie ends 
5. I remember both the girls who were definitely adults being quite main characters. Not older adults so I would say 20s. 
6. Definitely isn’t called black Christmas/Xmas or the attic. And definitely wasn’t called burnt offerings. 
7. I think it was set in America 
8. From what I remember it didn’t have any really famous actors or actresses in it, or they weren’t main characters

Last year I made a montage of 2024 in film and it was a 3 month process, but I was so proud and filled with energy when it was done that I am now making one for 2025 (Not to promote it, but in case you're interested in it feel free to watch it [here](https://youtu.be/SklgIvwxB28?si=zzA_ZD3KgLxhI7ws)). 

I'm sort of structuring the 2025 montage in three parts à la 'Sorry, Baby' (Opening section), 'Weapons' (Horror section) and The Life of Chuck (drama section). Last year I did multiple chapters inspired by Strange Darling and while I have done a lot of research for it (gathering footage, making sure I don't miss any important movies (I will be aiming for 250 movies in the montage), editing on the music), I have decided to ask you guys for help.

  
The questions I have for you guys are:   
\- Are there any shots that particularly moved you this year?   
  
\- Is there a certain line of dialogue that was immaculately delivered by an actor/actress that should make it in the montage?  
  
\- Is there a piece of musical score that I can add to the montage? (I've been experimenting to see if any of Sinner's tracks make sense in the montage for example)  
  
\- Is there an underrated/underseen movie that should make it in? (The chance I've added it to a list of mine is big, but drop it anyway in the chance I did miss it)

While I made last year's montage purely for myself, I kinda want to make it for other people as well, hence I hereby ask for any inspiration from you guys. Thanks for the help in advance :)

His character is flaaaaaaacid, neurotic, cowardly, fickle for most of the film - so unlike the usually steely or cocky Bruce we're used to.

Another ""overlooked performance"" I love is RDJ as Wayne Gayle in Natural Born Killers.

It's not necessarily a stretch for him but it's rarely mentioned when people think about iconic Robert Downey Jr roles, even though he was one of the most quotable parts of the film!!

That got me thinking...

What are some other ""overlooked"" or ""under appreciated"" performances that are somehow not often mentioned when discussing an actors body of work but are your fave?

Edit: I'm adding Ewan McGregor in Moulin Rouge. Until that point I'd only known him for Trainspotting.

1oxayk0,You've recently been made CFO of a movie chain and tasked with restoring your chain to profitability - what steps do you take?,,[deleted],movies,0,0.36,45,1763160103.0,2025-11-14 23:41:43,True,"I've been thinking about this because while I agree that the quality of the films are sometimes a problem, ambience goes a long way and the social experience of the cinema experience has been mortally wounded.

\- adjust pay scales to positively reflect current economic climate. An enthusiastic and happy staff, is a staff that is loyal and wants to help the cinema chain succeed. If staff discounts for family members have been phased out, introduce a long standing policy of allowing staff only matinee screens early mornings and late nights before and after opening hours. This would allow the staff to be more excited for screenings, and would help word of mouth.

\- To this end I think I'd keep the cost of tickets around £/$/€10, offer greater discounts for group and family bookings to make going to the cinema attractive, and reduce the cost of concessions while establishing a quality standards to be adhered to so the hot dogs don't look like they've spent two weeks being grilled, or that it doesn't feel like you have to remortgage your home.

\- I'd supplement this by taking advantage of things like the fad with popcorn buckets - reach merchandising agreements to make impulse buying more likely with reasonably priced. enthusiastic products that highlight the screenings on offer.

\- The movies should, in my option, be the default first option for your first date. On this subject, on a limited scale I'd explore the idea of concierge screening service that is more prestige; loveseat furniture that is comfortable, elevating cinema going to an experience and a night out.

\- Make kid's matinees attractive options for parents to drop off their little monsters. Prioritise screenings on Saturday mornings for kids and teenagers with a decent discount that includes munchies. Allow noise by all means, hire extra cleaning crew.

\- Repeat screenings. Offer a rotation of classic films that deserve to be remembered and curated, Increasing the frequency and volume of classic films more likely to appeal to pensioners and cinephiles.

\- Finally...Ban phone usage. A zero tolerance, hard line stance to excessive talking that disrupts the movies for patrons, a check at the door to remind customers to please \*silence\* /turn off their phones, with considerations for emergency services workers and carers.

* Why run? Why not just leave the paramedic and the cop in the ambulance and go hide somewhere. In the trunk of a parked car, in a building, anywhere. Wait for the heat to cool down.
* Why have all the ambulances run at once? Why not just release one of the decoys so all the cops follow that one not realizing it's a fake, then stagger all the other decoys after the first one gets captured. Way more effective than just throwing away the trick from the start
* Seriously? Paint a whole ambulance in a minute? Of course it's gonna stick out like a sore ass, or whatever that saying was. Not only is the ambulance livery still visible underneath, the paint is dripping and stripping, tons of overspray, and you still drive a boxy van with a siren on top and lots of elements specific to ambulances - the doors, the side lights, even the model itself

My thought arise from the fact, that I am really bad at pitching movies to my friends to watch together. There are a lot of great films, but I fail at making some them sound appealing. Just to name a few popular examples: Inglorious Basterds, Apocalypse Now, Dune, Oppenheimer, Lawrence of Arabia, Nightcrawler, Children of Men, Blade Runner, ...
 
All of these movies are not inherently joyful, optimistic or funny. Why do people (including me) watch movies like this and *like* them? And I am not talking about nerding out, discussing about how well crafted they are, how thoughtful the story is written etc... technicalities do not make a movie. But the story does, how it resonates with us and what it makes us feel.

However, why do we like movies, that make us feel sad, or scared? Why don't movies need a happy end? Are we bad people for liking war movies? Why do movies work, even if there is no single character you would call a good person?

>Why the need for so much gruesome, graphic violence? ~ Because it's so much fun, Jan! Get it!

>Are you not entertained?

Are we so bored by life that we are happy to feel at least some strong feelings, even if it is not joy?

I enjoy good movies. I like films that tell interesting stories. But are we actually entertained by them? And what does it say about us when we are?

The good news is that the critics have praised him but he's always got good reviews yet he's been acting so full of himself lately, like he's already made it and he's a huge star that it might put off people who prefer their movie stars to be humble. Part of the reason I don't want to see Jay Kelly is because it feels so narcissistic a project. 

All this talk about him replacing Tom Cruise. It took Cruise nearly 16 years of lead roles for him to achieve the mega star following he now has and besides, movie stars are no longer a thing. 

Powell has the talent to be the next Cruise but the era will hardly provide him that break and his arrogance and narcissism is giving more David Caruso than Cruise.

I notice that a lot here too. thanks

I’m just really confused about this and I haven’t found an answer that seems satisfying. They’re usually very vague and confusing, that make the director seem far away from everything, like the CEO of a company.

They usually say weird things like “they have the final say” or “they centralize the vision” but idk what those things mean or why they are so important to the *production* of the film. 

Final say, to me, makes me imagine that the people who work for the director just show the director things, and then the director either says “yes” and they move on, or “no” and they have to try something else. Doesn’t seem very involved to me..

Centralize the vision makes them sound like managers working with a team. Like a supervisor, looking over everybody’s shoulder and making comments and keeping them in line. While this is involving, it doesn’t seem very creatively important/fulfilling.

What confuses me is that people, more than any other job the industry besides maybe writing, *set out* with the desire to become a director. It has the reputation as being thing great and nexus of creativity, as if they are the greatest genius around, like it seems that the greatest way to prove yourself artistically is to become a director. Editors and cinematographers and actors and writers aspire to the role.

To me personally it seems like nothing more than a position of power. Everything large task needs a leader and the director fulfills that role. That’s why people want it. People love to credit those in power. People will definitely look at ANYTHING good about your movie(s) and post it online and say:”wow this is so good, I love [director], he is such a genius” No matter if it’s the editing the cinematography or the production design that is the center of the discussion.

But in really the director doesn’t cut the film, the EDITOR does. The don’t shoot the film, the CINEMATOGRAPHER does. the don’t design the production, the PRODUCTION DESIGNER does. They infact put a lot of work into their part of the film, leaving… what exactly for you to do? I don’t get it, they’re not really involved in anything. I mean they are, but again, how?? 

How am I supposed to look at a film and associate that with a director, what *is* the association?",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1owwe7w/ok_what_the_heck_does_a_director_do_and_why_do/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1owwe7w/ok_what_the_heck_does_a_director_do_and_why_do/,Question,False,False,False,False,2025-11-14,14,Friday

As someone who was born in the 2000s (literally in 2000) I grew up watching all of these now iconic comedy movies, like Superbad and White Chicks and The Hangover and a billion others. A lot of my really happy moments from when I was a kid is watching a comedy movie with my dad, and interestingly enough, that’s the part that I remember most looking back at my childhood, not the other things in my life like all the arguments my parents were having and stuff like that. And that’s because comedy movies are essentially a form of escapism, that’s why so many plots and subplots in these iconic comedy movies and TV shows are just absurd, we obviously know the chances of them happening in real life are next to nothing, but it’s still funny and allows us to get away from our actually depressing lives for a couple hours. Two male black FBI detectives going undercover as obnoxious rich white girls in order to solve some crime is ridiculous, but it works because it’s so hilarious and unrealistic.

Well the really sad thing now is life has honestly just gotten really depressing overall in the past decade. First we had Covid and all the depressing aspects that came with that, and just in the last 5 years, we’ve had multiple wars that have revealed really terrible social issues and divided pretty much everyone in society. I know the world has never really been peaceful, but I really just feel like the spark in humans has been flushed out in recent years. And I’m not even just talking about major social issues like war and Covid, but just day to day life is depressing for most people I know my age. Hours of doom scrolling on TikTok or Instagram to get that daily release of dopamine and as someone who is addicted to all those social outlets, not only is it insanely unhealthy to mindlessly scroll on your phone for hours all day but it also just really destroys creativity. And this might just be a me thing, but I really don’t enjoy most movies that come out today, not to mention comedy movies that are all just boring and unfunny. There’s a lot of reasons for it, I personally think it’s a combination of comedians turning to podcasts as a source of comedic release instead of movies and the influence of cancel culture. It’s just really sad what’s happening in society right now and it kind of depresses me. Not to mention how AI has literally taken over everything, and I genuinely believe that in 10 years or so, humans creating movies and TV shows might start to become a thing of the past, which is also a terribly scary thought.",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1owoyov/im_honestly_just_depressed_at_the_lack_of_comedy/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1owoyov/im_honestly_just_depressed_at_the_lack_of_comedy/,Discussion,False,False,False,False,2025-11-14,7,Friday

As far as we know, he wasn’t a postman before going to Vietnam. So maybe this detail is part of the world his mind constructs as he’s dying, like everything else that happens outside the war.

There’s a scene where a few women on the street see him in uniform and start singing “Please Mr. Postman.” He smiles at them and seems happy/flattered, one of the few times in the movie where he seems happy. I wonder if “Please Mr. Postman” might have been playing on a radio in the field hospital where the Army doctors were trying to save him, and the song became embedded in his subconscious as he was dying. Or maybe the song was just somewhere in his subconscious already.

Also, a postman is a messenger, someone who moves between worlds delivering communication from one place to another. In Jacob’s case, he’s a kind of messenger between life and death, walking the streets of New York that seem to exist on the border between the living and the dead. His job might mirror his existential position: caught in transit, carrying fragments of messages and memories.

I’m curious whether anyone else has ever thought about this?

These movies are so insanely context clue heavy paying constant attention and figuring out what the characters are thinking by them looking at something the camera isn't exactly focusing on so much that it directly tells you, but it is showing is sometimes so hard for me. 

(YOU CAN SKIP THE DETAILS IF YOU WANT TO):

For example in Lady Vengeance when the serial murderer is set up in his home, I totally blanked on wtf was happening and how exactly the events were unfolding logically. I watched a podcast on it later where they describe her setting this up with the wife of the murderer guy and how she helped her in prison so she was playing the wife role for her (Also: it didnt exactly help that in that scene they literally dont show the wifes face just to fuck with me even more so that i dont put together who she is). I got the part where the murderer told the wife to come home because he found out from the pictures who she was talking to, but here's the thing: The pastor (who shows up in the beginning) who showed him the pictures, i never got the clue that he was actually spying on them, like i wasnt consciously thinking that when he showed the guy the photos, I never consciously put together that Geum-ja the main character was specifically manipulating everyone in prison to then help her, when she said i was planning it for 13 years, i didnt get what she meant.   
  
That whole first part of the movie is so hazy and blurry for me like when she went to cut off her fingers to show atonement, i almost wasnt even paying attention to connect what that means. When she was torturing the murderer and saw the little toys he had with the orange ball, i didnt realize till later that that means he has more victims, i just thought it meant that she got reminded of what he did so it motivated her to kill him, ignoring the other toys. 

Basically:

Just straight up not being conscious about a lot of stuff and hard to keep track of things that are mentioned at the start of movies.   
  
I feel pretty sure about having ADHD, so i came here to ask if there are any people with ADHD here who find these kinds of context clue heavy movies hard to watch.",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1owglbx/the_vengeance_trilogy_and_adhd/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1owglbx/the_vengeance_trilogy_and_adhd/,Discussion,False,False,False,False,2025-11-14,0,Friday

Another example is digital things like me enhancing images ‘blow it up’ or the instantaneousness of facial recognition.

Some Reviews:

[Variety - Owen Gliebermann](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/the-running-man-review-glenn-powell-edgar-wright-1236574249/)

>Released in 1987, “The Running Man” was a lumbering Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. You could say that Edgar Wright, the director of the new version, has made it into a decent Bruce Willis movie. The staging is crisp with sadistic timing, the human element rarely overshadows the rigorously staged mayhem, and Glen Powell, as a family man from the lower depths who becomes the survivor hero of a deadly competition show that’s like “The Most Dangerous Game” updated to the age of reality-TV insanity, uses his small darting eyes and buff bod and quick delivery to conjure the vicious spirit that is sometimes, according to the logic of a film like this one, decency’s only recourse. Powell, born and raised in Texas, knows how to chisel his features into a mean glare of revenge. But there’s still something fundamentally sweet about him; he’s doing an impersonation of ’80s-action-hero heartlessness.

[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/11/the-running-man-review-glen-powell-edgar-wright-stephen-king-future-shock-sci-fi-satire) \- 3 / 5

>The resulting film is never anything but likable and fun – though never actually disturbing in the way that it’s surely supposed to be. Yet there’s plenty of enjoyment to be had. Wright accelerates to a sprint for some full-tilt chase sequences; there’s a nice punk aesthetic with protest ’zines being produced by underground rebels; and Wright always delivers those sugar-rush pop slams on the soundtrack, including, of course, the Spencer Davis Group’s Keep on Running. It’s a quirk of fate that The Running Man arrives in the same year as The Long Walk, also from a King book: a similar idea, only it’s walking not running.

[SlashFilm - Chris Evangelista](https://www.slashfilm.com/2023415/the-running-man-glen-powell-edgar-wright-movie-review/) \- 5 / 10

>For all his skills, Wright seemingly can't pin down what he wants ""The Running Man"" to be. The action isn't very exciting, the satire is unoriginal, and the over-reliance on weird product placement (both Liquid Death *and* Monster Energy get distracting shout-outs here) make the entire picture feel manufactured. I had high hopes that Wright could get ""The Running Man"" across the finish line, but the film stumbles right out of the gate.

[The Independent - Clarisse Loughrey](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/the-running-man-review-glen-powell-b2862079.html) \- 2 / 5

>The Running Man is a near-total failure. What should, quite easily, feel like a mirror’s been smashed and its pieces methodically jammed between our ribs feels closer to a friendly knock on the shoulder. The material’s all there, yet there’s none of the urgency.

[IGN - 7 / 10](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-running-man-review-glen-powell-edgar-wright)

>It’s a very well put-together film, and more so than not, it’s full of charming performances, clever little details and some less-outlandish-than-I’d-like social commentary. Even though Edgar Wright’s stamp isn’t clearly on every sequence like some of his previous work, The Running Man sprints where it needs to, giving Glen Powell his first chance to be a full-fledged action hero. It’s a movie that lives up to its heritage but gets a little tonally caught between the book and its first, more Arnold-y adaptation, and does a few different things pretty well instead of doing one thing really well. It’s a solid movie, one that I’m looking forward to watching again, but I don’t think it’s running quite hard enough.

[LiveforFilm - Sarah Louise Dean](https://www.liveforfilm.com/2025/11/11/review-the-running-man-is-one-powell-after-another/)

>The actors give their all, the world feels real and as always with a Wright movie, the soundtrack is sensational, but there is almost nothing that makes this film a preferential watch to its superior predecessor. Yet there is a light at the end of this booby-trapped tunnel. He’s not the next Schwarzenegger, nor another Cruise. *The Running Man* showcases Glen Powell as the natural successor to Bruce Willis, and that’s a platform worth running on.

[NextBestPicture - Giovanni Lago](https://nextbestpicture.com/the-running-man/) \- 5 / 10

>Edgar Wright creates solid enough action, but it's far from the level of creativity we've come to know from him. It doesn't help that the pacing and tonal issues only mask an action film that comes off more as an aesthetic siphoning of King's work than a meaningful adaptation.

[ScreenDaily - Nikki Baughan](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-running-man-review-edgar-wrights-bombastic-stephen-king-adaptation-doesnt-go-the-distance/5210845.article)

>Edgar Wright’s bombastic Stephen King adaptation doesn’t go the distance. *The Running Man* has a great deal in common with *The Long Walk* – another dystopian story about desperate men attempting to win a heinous contest of survival, recently adapted by Francis Lawrence. But whereas Lawrence’s film dug into the political nuances of this social set-up, and the psychology of those on both sides of the divide – and was all the more impactful for it – here, these potentially more interesting corners have been shaved off to make way for an easily-digestible popcorn actioner.

[AwardsWatch - Jay Ledbetter](https://awardswatch.com/the-running-man-review-edgar-wright-calls-out-americas-wrongs-in-the-latest-and-largely-pointless-stephen-king-adaptation-c/) \- 'C+'

>The moral of the story is this: walk, don’t run, to *The Running Man*. It’s a testament to Edgar Wright that *The Running Man* feels like a little bit of a letdown, as it never bores and has ideas on its mind, which is more than most movies can say. Maybe the era of Wright being on the cutting edge of genre filmmaking is simply over; time comes for us all, after all. Perhaps the $110 million price tag put more external pressure on him than he was accustomed to. Whatever the case may be, *The Running Man* is a satisfying film without a tremendous amount of stickiness. Glen Powell’s forehead vein notwithstanding, the film has little pop. It looks… fine enough. Its editing is… good for pretty much everybody else but doesn’t inspire like Wright’s best work. The character motivation is… consistent, at least? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1oui2fc/edgar_wrights_the_running_man_review_thread/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1oui2fc/edgar_wrights_the_running_man_review_thread/,Review,False,False,False,False,2025-11-11,19,Tuesday

I don't think the title ""Roofman"" really suits much to a crime comedy film..

My newest documentary, SANTACON, is about the origin story of the world's most hated holiday, SantaCon! It is premiering at DOC NYC on November 13th.  Ask me anything!

**Synopsis:**

They built Burning Man. They inspired Fight Club. Then they created Santacon… and totally lost control of it as an anarchy-fueled 1990s prank transformed into a drunken, violent shitshow; and the world's most hated holiday.

**Here's our trailer:**

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7C0WCqBICw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7C0WCqBICw)   
\---------------------------------

Today, Santacon is known as perhaps the single most hated event on the planet. A dreaded day in which tens of thousands of drunk idiots dress like Santa and invade countless cities around the world to live out their drunkest and most violent instincts.

But it began as something else entirely: A piece of Dada street theater designed to shock people out of their everyday existence by creating a sense of awe and confusion.

The folks who started Santacon in the ‘90s are the same people who started Burning Man (and also lost control of that as the culture took hold of it) and who served as the real-life inspiration for Fight Club and Project Mayhem. And today, they want nothing to do with their Christmas creation.

Welcome to SANTACON: An immersive documentary about how great ideas can transform into something sinister--and what it's like to accept and live in a world you no longer understand.

Told with exclusive access to the event's original creators and with countless hours of never-before-seen home movies from the ‘90s, you’ll be transported back in time to a world of awe, wonder, and endless possibility.

It feels like this situation goes against the movie's rule no.1 which is that anyone who takes NZT is far smarter and their reactions are way quicker than of any other average person. It's why Lindy escaped from a seemingly unsolvable situation when being pursued, why Eddie defeated a group of men by himself and why he knew that the van was going to hit the taxi at the end of the movie.

The movie ending makes no sense to me because it's apparently impossible to decieve or surprise a person while they're on NZT.  If this rule was honoured then Grennady would have a huge advantage over Eddie the second the drug kicks in and couldn't be outsmarted by him hiding a knife behind his back. Does anyone have any explanation for why NZT didn't save Grennady from being killed or is it simply a plot hole? I still really enjoy the movie but I'm curious about this.

My Pop loved ‘older’ Japanese Films, particularly from the ‘50s & ‘60s. Unlike my Pop, I could & can understand very little Japanese, so many films were unavailable to me as those ‘older’ films often didn’t have subtitles. I’d still go with Pop anyway as I enjoy the cinematography, the choreography, &’the storyline. Oftentimes Pop would jot down ‘cheat sheets’ so I’d have some better understanding of what was going on in the film. Struck me back then & still strikes me now how most of these works are so well directed, written, & acted, that so much is easily understood without the dialogue.
Tatsuya Nakadai became a favorite of mine & Pop was quite happy about that, as he’d long admired him. Highly talented & very popular, the Ace director Akira Kurosawa often called upon him.
Of the couple hundred films he’s made, for now I’ll recommend two:
“I Am A Cat”
From the mid ‘70s, only recently available with subtitles, & a hoot! A satirical comedy that’s not about cats. Is about seeing humans through a cats eyes, possibly bettering our human view of each other. Highly recommend! Jûzô Itami has a prominent role, Mariko Okada shines as always.
“The Trusted Confidant” which is incorrectly translated from Fūrinkazan, which means Wind, Forest, Fire, Mountain. That’s from a poetic phrase in Lao Tzu’s “The Art of War”: ""Be like a wind in a rapid march, a woods in a steady march, a fire in a raid, a mountain in a standoff."" This somewhat explains the focus of the series. A drama deep with intrigue, much historical basis, & lots of well choreographed action. All takes place during the 16th century ‘Warring Period’, when warlords were always in battle, with often changing alliances. Every episode ends with a short documentary that shows the modern days sites of the battles, shrines, castles, portrayed in that episode. With Mr Nakadai, there’s the great Takeshi Katô [“Only The Brave”] & Gackt. Top recommendation for all of this 50 episode series.
[Note: for my 🇯🇵 friends, I’m sorry for any wrong letters or spelling. Pupu Platter of memory pfft & fingers not cooperating holding the letters to pick the correct alternate. argh]
Anytime you see Tatsuya Nakadai, I recommend you check that film out!

What a blast ya’ll. It’s not some ”great movie of our time” or hidden cinematic gem, its just a fun ass movie from start to finish. Makes for a good movie night movie.

The decisions he makes are frustrating but (spoilers) consistently choosing to destroy the entirety of the existing timeline with no heed to the consequences of your actions just because you wouldn’t otherwise be able to hook up with your crush is absolutely something my 16 year old ass would have done.

I never get tired of this movie. Made on a budget of ""khrr\*cough\*hrrrgh Dollar"" (according to Campbell's audio commentary), using his own property, My Name is Bruce oozes love for film making and the trademark Campbell humor.

There are only a handful of films for that can really be watched anytime and are always fun.  
This is one of them.  
Is it a movie that people can enjoy when they are not fans of the Bruce?  
I am pretty sure. It is a gem of low budget filmmaking. Cambell's audio commentary is also hilariously informative.

And no one talks about how this movie probably inspired a lot of Nick Cage's ""The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent"", and other movies of the genre ""ageing B movie stars playing themselves or a version of themselves in a genre movie"".

Some Reviews:

[IndieWire - Kate Erbland](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/now-you-see-me-3-review-1235159596/) \- 'B-'

>What follows is a globe-trotting adventure (half in CGI World, some of it in Abu Dhabi) with a steadily growing cast of characters that, to their and Fleischer’s credit, remain always recognizable, often funny, and mostly enjoyable to watch mix and mingle. The crime-fighting? That’s nice, but the real fun is in the bonding, most of it at the hand of oddly wholesome sequences in which they all try to one-up each other’s magical skills.

[San Francisco Chronicle - Zaki Hasan](https://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/article/now-you-see-me-3-review-21135473.php) \-

>By the time the credits roll, “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” feels like a franchise finally in control of its own illusion. It recaptures the wonder of the first film, corrects the excesses of the second, and adds a warmth and cohesion that elevates it above both — delivering its most impressive trick yet.

[NextBestPicture - Dan Bayer](https://nextbestpicture.com/now-you-see-me-now-you-dont/) \- 7 / 10

>The heart of the “Now You See Me” series has always been in pulling the rich and powerful down off their pedestals and delivering some entertainingly on-point justice. The joy of watching has only grown in the near-decade since “Now You See Me 2,” and while the series’ Obama-era optimism may not go down quite as easily these days, “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t” still packs a hugely entertaining punch. Yes, it’s ridiculous. No, it doesn’t make perfect sense. But, damn, if it isn’t a hoot and a half to watch. And especially in the midst of prestige movie season, it’s just the blast of good, old-fashioned, big-budget Hollywood entertainment that audiences need.

[InSessionFilm - M.N. Miller](https://insessionfilm.com/movie-review-now-you-see-me-now-you-dont/) \- 'D+'

>When real illusion is replaced with comic-book spectacle, the CGI sleight of hand leaves the film with no tension, no awe, and no sense of risk. Not to mention, the real magic of any movie, the plot, is so convoluted that we aren’t even sure how they got there. I would call it fraud. Then there’s the issue of movies like this setting up sequels or resurrecting beloved characters solely to manufacture an emotional moment that’s hardly earned. 

[IGN - Eric Goldman](https://www.ign.com/articles/now-you-see-me-now-you-dont-review-jesse-eisenberg-woody-harrelson) \- 6 / 10

>The Now You See Me films have never completely landed the “Ocean’s Eleven But With Magic” vibe they seem to aspire to, thanks to more outwardly cheesy and questionable moments, and characters that feel especially flimsy, even for a large ensemble of this type. Still, Now You See Me: Now You Don’t serves as a reminder of how they manage to coast by just enough, providing a good time thanks to the notable talent and charm of their expanding cast and the inclusion of the magic trick element to provide a unique flair. It’s the epitome of “We’re just having fun here” entertainment, and while little of it resonates, it mostly gets the job done.",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1oueaug/now_you_see_me_now_you_dont_review_thread/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1oueaug/now_you_see_me_now_you_dont_review_thread/,Review,False,False,False,False,2025-11-11,17,Tuesday

1ow4ims,"Just rewatched ""(500) Days of Summer"" and it's honestly a masterclass in modern relationship dynamics",1vimi095n9,OD29NEXUS,movies,0,0.26,16,1763048858.0,2025-11-13 16:47:38,True,"I just finished watching this movie again and wow, it hit differently this time. I think this film is genuinely one of the best representations of how relationships actually work (or don't work) in real life, and it's aged incredibly well.

**TL;DR for those who haven't seen it:** The movie follows Tom, a hopeless romantic who falls hard for Summer, a woman who doesn't believe in love or relationships. It's told non-linearly across 500 days, showing the highs and lows of their relationship. The twist? Summer was upfront from day one that she didn't want anything serious, but Tom kept hoping she'd change her mind. The film brilliantly deconstructs the ""manic pixie dream girl"" trope and shows how we often project our fantasies onto people rather than seeing them for who they really are.

**Why I think it's so relevant:**

The movie doesn't pick sides—it shows Tom's genuine feelings while also highlighting how he ignored every sign that they wanted different things. Summer wasn't the villain for being honest about what she wanted, and Tom wasn't wrong for catching feelings. They were just incompatible, and that's okay.

It also does an amazing job showing how we romanticize relationships in hindsight, literally showing the ""Expectations vs. Reality"" split screen that lives rent-free in my head.

**Questions for discussion:**
- Do you think the movie is fair to both characters, or does it lean toward one perspective?
- How do you interpret the ending? Optimistic or just Tom repeating the same pattern?
- Does Summer get too much hate from viewers, or is the criticism valid?
- What scene hit you the hardest?

It's definitely worth watching, and I'd like to see more films like it.

Muppet Christmas Carol and Treasure Island are stand outs in their own right. I even enjoyed what James Bobin did with his 2011 Muppets movie.

Smart writing, a lot of heart, well crafted jokes, and plenty of scenes to enjoy on their own. That’s a Muppet movie I can describe at best. Even the occasional fourth wall break is telling me the crew is having fun.

Kermit on a log, Kermit riding on a bike, Jim Henson and Frank Oz performing in an upside down bi-plane 18 feet above ground. There’s a lot to enjoy once you know some behind the scenes magic.

All of them do achieve on their simplicity and comedy. Even the celebrity roles and cameos have a lot of fun while playing things straight.

Meanwhile, Barbarian was a top 5 2022 film for me. I absolutely loved it. And I watched it again and liked it just as much. So, I was of course excited for Weapons.

1oun8pv,Ridley Scott's Legend 1985,728avqwq,Neet2155,movies,17,0.74,12,1762899106.0,2025-11-11 23:11:46,True,"I just finished watching this film for the second time after many years. Of course, I am referring to the Director's Cut. For those of you that have checked out some of my other posts pertaining to a particular unofficial cut of Blade Runner, you'll find that this post will be me discussing and championing an official release of Ridley's film, Legend. 

I watched it with my mother just a moment ago and I must say, that the film is absolutely spectacular. For those of you who have seen it and those who have yet to, allow me to assure you that it is a TRUE Ridley film with underlying themes of humans and all creatures being capable of ""darkness"" and no one is truly pure of heart. It is very conceptual and pretty much does for the Fantasy genre, what Blade Runner did for the Sci-fi and Cyber-Punk genre. Like a Ridley Scott movie, unfortunately, he wasn't given proper creative freedom during it's production and the best version of the movie would be the director's cut. 

The film is very gorgeous to look at and is incredibly atmospheric with music that fits each and every scene. The fantasy films such as Labyrinth, Never Ending Story, Pan's Labyrinth, Excalibur, and Dark Crystal do certain things better and I mean way better, especially the latter two films mentioned. But Legend just feels MORE complete and has far more creativity that fits the standards of its genre. We have Trolls, Elves, Fairies, Princess', and one of the best representations of ""evil"" on film, played by none other than the underrated Tim Curry, in full make-up and prosthetics. We have beautiful forests, a world covered in snow and darkness, fire dungeons, and dark castles, as well as magical creatures with fascinating lore. Very rich story that requires a rewatch from time to time. 

I am not sure how it worked out so well but all the charming characters, such as Oona the Fairy, Gump the Elf, Jack The Forest Child, Lily the Princess, The Goblins, and of course, Darkness itself, are utilized beautifully in this fairy tale, with Lily (played by Mia Sara so wonderfully), not necessarily being the traditional ""damsel in distress"", but outsmarting Darkness and setting the Unicorn free, despite being corrupted slightly by the witch's spell. All these things worked so well but not just because of the set pieces, the characters, and costumes, but also because of the very capable director involved. 

As great as everything mentioned was, and it was in fact great, like a lot of Ridley Scott movies, this isn't necessarily Lord of the Rings, nor is it Gladiator or American Gangster (Wonderful films enjoyed by most people). In fact, it is very much so a unique and niche film meant for a certain individuals but that's okay! Topics such as these are why we champion good directors to be able to have their creative freedom...because what may not mean much to you nor I, can mean the whole world for someone else. And I know that somewhere, this film existing in its purest form has made someone a very happy person (yes Mia Sara and Tom Cruise are very hot in it). It's made me happy 😊

I'll champion this film as one of my favorite Fantasy movies alongside Dark Crystal, Excalibur, and Lord of the Rings and one of my favorite Ridley Scott movies.

The intro felt like they were just trying to match the intensity of the first two movies' intros. It didn't give that same anxiety the first films did.

The father-son dynamic was whatever. Least interesting part of this movie. 

I think everyone can agree that the scene of Alpha chasing them home was pretty bad ass, I won't lie. I don't like the idea of an Alpha, but that was cool. 

The way the kid sneaked out with his mom is just... okay... nobody notices? Right.

Then there's the soldiers. The zombies aren't even really zombies. They're infected people. They die when you shoot them in the chest. How the fuck did so many of you idiots die so fast?

The baby scene was fucking gnarly. To be honest, I agreed with the soldier 100%. Fuck y'all and fuck that stupid zombie baby.
 
The way they deal with Samson is so lame. It's like, put him out then cut his fucking head off! There better be an explanation for why he wasn't killed.

The whole monument idea is so goofy to me. 

Now, the end. What the fuck? What the fuck. The fuck was that? Who the fuck thought that was a good idea?

The mom was hands down the best actor of this movie. She fucking NAILED it. I loved the way they handled her. The doctor was also such a pleasant surprise. I thought he was going to be (extra) weird.

I gave it a 6/10

I was truly disappointed.

But Samson killing dudes with their friends' heads was pretty funny.",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ovsps0/i_finally_watched_28_years_later/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ovsps0/i_finally_watched_28_years_later/,Spoilers,False,False,False,False,2025-11-13,6,Thursday

Kids will side with the parent that likes to have fun than the structured parent.

See Miranda POV, she comes home to animals everywhere and a cop telling her that she can be fined. Open the door to a messy house, kids all over the place, and animals walking throughout the house. Daniel contradicted her when Chris couldn't have a party due to his report card but she didn't cancel his birthday. She came home with a birthday cake and a few gifts for him but since she was going to be home late Daniel sidesteps her and throws a big expensive party. Animals aren't cheap.

He deceives Miranda by being Mrs. Doubtfire and Miranda is paying him $300 a week. She's paying him $1200 a month. Who wouldn't be upset to learn that they're paying their ex by being deceived. 

He could've killed Stu, overhearing that he's allergic to pepper. What does he do? Puts pepper in Stu's food. Daniel should know that it wasn't going to end well when Stu eats it. 

I'm not saying Miranda is innocent cause her dating Stu while in middle of divorce isn't a good look. She could've communicated a little better even if speaking to Daniel is a little difficult for her.

I do understand it can be stressful to be the main breadwinner while your spouse doesn't have steady income, not on the same page when it comes to disciplining the kids.

Watching videos about why and reading fan opinions made me want to rewatch them to get a better understanding, and so I bought the trilogy on DVD and while my appreciation for the first one grew I was still pretty indifferent about the last two, and my opinion didn’t change much the second time I watched the dvd set. But now that I’ve watched parts I and II again I think I can finally appreciate why the second one is so highly praised. 

It does everything the first movie did, but does it even better. The scenery, cinematography, the symbolism, the music, and most importantly the acting. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a better acted movie in my life, especially Al Pacino as Michael. I’ve never seen anger conveyed so convincingly than in any other performance, and I think the movie perfectly contrasts Vito’s rise with Michael’s fall. 

I feel like my biggest mistake was assuming that it would be as action heavy as the first and being disappointed that there was a lot more talking scenes, but I think watching it again knowing full well what to expect helped me appreciate it more, and to understand how necessary those scenes are.

It feels like most of the world watches international films because their film industries aren't big enough to watch endless Hollywood movies... It's also cool to get glimpses of different cultures around the world. Another thing is that a lot of foreign film are almost artistic, in a way that's similar to good indie films. Don't get me wrong, I love American films, but a lot of them these days makes me think attention spans have decreased(Marvel, John Wick). It's like why aren't these movies adding more artistic emphasis. I see way more artsy shots in indie and foreign movies. Does the average man just like action, a decent plot, and cookie cutter formulaic narratives? Do they even understand artsy metaphorical shots? Idk. Not sure why people like this type of shit.

Whoopi Goldberg has been working regularly with tremendous success in show business for over 40 years. IMBD gives her 212 acting roles, including The Color Purple, Sister Act, Ghost, Lion King, Toy Story 3.

She is an EGOT winner (one of only 27 apparently). She won her Oscar for the movie Ghost.

She was one of the highest grossing actors of the 20th century.

OK... wonderful accolades, but I find this a bit surprising.

She's likeable, but it's not like her acting performances are unbelievable. She's comedic, but it's not like they're hilarious. Sister act is a weird slow movie known for 1 or 2 songs totaling like 5 minutes, but it's a huge international hit... about a nun...

Whoopi isn't a bombshell knockout model like contemporaries Julie Roberts and Michelle Pfieffer.

Whoopi is also black, and it's not like there were a heck of a lot of well established black actresses in the 1980s and 90s.

Also... her name is Whoopi. WHOOPI. Her last name is Goldberg. GOLDBERG.

Also she has no eyebrows. Think about that. Eyebrows are kinda important for showing emotion. Showing emotion is important for actors. Whoopi has no eyebrows.

I feel like Whoopi has perhaps the most remarkable, unlikely, astounding career success of any actor ever.

From what I remember, it mostly took place in an apartment or townhouse? Belonging to a couple where the husband was a playwright (It's possible he was a screenwriter for movies but I think it was plays). He has a new play in theaters that will open soon, and he asks an old friend to review it for him. His friend is a highly respected critic who has his reviews posted in all the big local papers.

However, the play ends up being quite terrible, and the friend writes a negative yet honest review about it, without telling the writer beforehand that his review will be negative.

The writer feels absolutely betrayed by his friend and confronts him, as this could ruin his career as a playwright (I cannot remember if he was a struggling playwright or a first time playwright).
The friend tells him that it would ruin *his* career if he wrote a dishonest review, and tension escalates between them.

1otq7lv,"""Rango"" is a triumph of meta-modern storytelling.",ezvaj,ButlerWimpy,movies,154,0.84,34,1762809240.0,2025-11-10 22:14:00,True,"I recently re-watched the 2011 animated film Rango, and was reminded of how well it incorporates contemporary ideas about constructing one's own identity into the framework of a classic ""hero's journey"" morality tale. To me, it juggles postmodern existentialism, individualist modernism, and (somewhat subversively) traditional morality in a clever way. It starts out as existential because the chameleon character starts out with no identity and has to create one based on the situation he finds himself in. (Obviously, he's a chameleon.) But, importantly, he also has an internal idea of the story he'd like to tell based on his imagination, which defines his lonely fish tank existence, and seemingly inspired by cinema (he fancies himself as an actor). Unfortunately for him, he isn't able to successfully bring that self-constructed (but externally influenced) story into reality by his own volition. He fails, and is left wandering in the desert. 

The movie's core scene is brought into play when Rango (which the chameleon names himself) deconstructs the walls of the story he's set himself in and allows himself to be guided across the road, not by way of his own heroism but by closing his eyes and trusting in something external. There he is confronted by the Spirit of the West, who in one sense represents traditional morality (he is portrayed as omniscient, a ""higher being"" as a human amongst animals, and provides Rango moral guidance), but is also representative of both modernist hero narratives (individualist American Westerns) and, complicatedly, postmodern anti-hero narratives (spaghetti Westerns). It would have been more straightforward to just use John Wayne or something and reinforce modernist individualism, but rather than being on-the-nose, using the Man with No Name incorporates the complications of fractured identity into the movie's resolution.

He tells Rango that Rango is trying to ""find something that isn't out here""--that ""something"" being Rango's preconceived notion of what his story should be, or needs to be. For the story to be merely existentialist, the thread would end with that deconstruction of the notion of a traditionally defined goal. But, the Spirit follows with the message that ""it's not about you, it's about them."" This is traditional morality undermining Rango's self-important, self-constructed role as a modernist hero, and reinforcing that he needs to define himself not by a myopic view of what ""heroes should be,"" but instead define himself by the moral service he is able to provide others. The spirit then symbolically ""boxes in"" Rango, framing him as if on a movie screen, implying that Rango has confined himself by the modernist, classic Hollywood ideal of a Hero narrative. The spirit then rides away with the remark that ""no man can walk out on his own story,"" summarizing the philosophy of the film by submitting that we all inescapably exist within a larger story, but despite that larger framework which is the ""story"" of human existence, it is also *our own* story, in which our individual identity and choices must be guided by both traditional morality, and a sense of the individual talents and limitations that make us ourselves. Not solely what the modernist hero story imposes on us.

So, rather than being simply deconstructionist and postmodern, it is instead meta-modern, acknowledging the postmodern moral uncertainty of a post-WWII, post-nuclear world, and the utility of modernist hero narratives, but rejecting the naivety of either philosophy on its own, and instead incorporating both, along with traditional morality, towards a more nuanced positive message. 

It's not unique in doing so; plenty of other stories since around the 2000s have been doing similar things. But it does a really good job of it. The surreal presentation serves the philosophy of the narrative as well. The rendering of the environments and characters is scientifically realistic, but the logic the world works in, the way things move and act, is cartoony and dream-like. It marries the grounded, directed certainty of modernism with the absurdity of postmodernism. The genre tropes and Western cliches are at once treated with reverence and also undermined by the subtle, tongue-in-cheek acting and occasional naturalistic dialogue. The mariachi owls reinforce the self-awareness that the movie is playing with narrative presentation itself and examining the utility of traditional storytelling frameworks, which is meta-modern.",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1otq7lv/rango_is_a_triumph_of_metamodern_storytelling/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1otq7lv/rango_is_a_triumph_of_metamodern_storytelling/,Review,False,False,False,False,2025-11-10,22,Monday
1ouknut,"I wish I could go back and watch ""This is Spinal Tap"" the first time again!",3ud30jaf,jdub67a,movies,3,0.56,8,1762893241.0,2025-11-11 21:34:01,True,"I recently watched Spinal Tap II: The End Continues, and I have to say—it was surprisingly satisfying. Nostalgic, at least for me. It’s not as polished as the original, but I still found myself laughing out loud many times. Naturally, that got me wanting to revisit the first film. So I figured, why not?

I remember the first time I saw This Is Spinal Tap. I didn’t catch it in the theater (judging by the box office, I wasn’t alone). My roommate rented it sometime around 1989, and we fired up the good ol’ VCR to watch this movie about a heavy metal band. Cool, I thought. I like heavy metal!

Right from the start, I recognized Marty DiBergi as Rob Reiner—I’d seen plenty of All in the Family growing up—so I knew something was up. But I wasn’t sure what. The idea of a “mockumentary” was totally new to me. The film looked like a real documentary… until they launched into the first song.

Now, the memory’s a bit fuzzy after nearly 40 years, but I clearly remember thinking, Wait—this music is actually pretty good! At least catchy. And funny as hell. Plus, these guys were clearly playing and singing for real. That made it even more confusing!

Remember, there was no internet back in ’89.

I couldn’t just Google it. For a moment, I actually wondered if this was some British band I’d just never heard of. But then—Rob Reiner? Maybe it wasn’t the guy from All in the Family? (Nowadays, I’d just jump on IMDb in two seconds flat to check.)

One flashback scene really sticks out—the Thamesmen from 1965. I remember thinking, ""Wait, is that the guy from that medical show on TV?"" (Ed Begley Jr playing the drums, I'd seen him on St. Elsewhere by then) Somewhere around there, it finally clicked. I don’t remember exactly when, but I do remember we laughed our asses off for the rest of the movie.

As a mockumentary, This Is Spinal Tap is hilarious. But what sets it apart from every other mockumentary I’ve seen since is the music. It’s not just funny—it’s genuinely good. Shockingly good, in fact.  At least for me.

Ah, but that first time. (Not that, watching Tap, you pervs.) That confusion mixed with intrigue—I don't think another movie has ever quite put me in that same headspace since.

As for Spinal Tap II, I’d definitely recommend it. There are some great callbacks to the original, fun cameos, and let’s just say Elton and Paul’s “cameos” are a lot more than cameos.  Honestly, it might make a great play. The film only uses five or six different main sets, so it already feels like it could easily translate to the stage. But given that these guys are pushing 80 (and in Harry Shearer’s case, already past it), I totally get why they kept things simple.

I also got the sense that they originally had more ambitious plans, or maybe had to scale things back during production. The early interview segments — before the reunion happens — make it seem like the reunion is still very much in doubt. It feels like there were supposed to be more scenes exploring why they were getting back together beyond just the ""I inherited the contract from Uncle Ian"" storyline. That whole sequence felt a little off or incomplete to me.

That said, even those moments still had some great laughs sprinkled in, so it’s hard to complain too much. Tap has always been about the mix of awkwardness and absurdity, and The End Continues definitely keeps that spirit alive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ouknut/i_wish_i_could_go_back_and_watch_this_is_spinal/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ouknut/i_wish_i_could_go_back_and_watch_this_is_spinal/,Discussion,False,False,False,False,2025-11-11,21,Tuesday

1ou5zpi,Freeway (1996) was a blast to watch.,vq7m0s3w,Hurdy_Gurdy_Man_84,movies,12,0.75,7,1762856731.0,2025-11-11 11:25:31,True,"I went into Matthew Bright's **Freeway** *(1996)* knowing only about its main cast and that it was a modern-day retelling of the Red Riding Hood fable. I had seen **Guncrazy** *(1992)* which was written by Bright, so I could predict that Freeway also had similar aesthetic, such as ""trailer trash"" characters and social commentary on how the system is complicit in harassing the poor and downtrodden and keeping them down.

I thought Guncrazy was just okay, nothing special. I thought it spent too much time in setting up the scenario and too little on the main story of two fugitives. However, Freeway proved to be a blast to watch from start to finish.

The cast is excellent and performed way better than I could predict. Reese Witherspoon is perfect as a teen from the poor white trash community, prone to emotional outbursts owing to her dysfunctional and abusive upbringing. This might just be her best acting performance ever. Kiefer Sutherland is also great as an outwardly normal and charming but unhinged killer.

The first half scenes in the car between Witherspoon and Sutherland where he takes her into his confidence and gradually reveals his ulterior motives to her, are a masterclass in building tension and anticipation. It's immensely satisfying to see the victim turn the tables on the villain.

The characters are multi-dimensional, as even though our sympathy is supposed to be with the heroine, we cannot help but feel a little repulsed by her due to some of her clearly criminal and remorseless actions in the second half; and conversely we also feel a little sorry (only a little) for the villain for what he suffers.

The social satire is also on point. We see how the protagonist suffers due to the apathy of the system and prejudice against her kind and how the same system views and rewards the antagonist as an upstanding citizen.

So, these are my thoughts on Freeway, which is *must recommended* to people who dig crime thrillers.

As a bonus, I will also write a few thoughts on the spiritual sequel **Freeway II: Confessions of a Trickbaby** *(1999)*.

Like Freeway, this one is also a modernized take on a fable - Hansel and Gretel this time. In many ways, this film is even more extreme and ""out there"" compared to Freeway. There is more nudity and sex and more depiction of perversions as well. However, simply being *more outrageous* does not automatically mean *better*. There are long stretches where nothing interesting happens. There is a ""trail of bread crumbs"" scene where crack cocaine is used instead of bread crumbs. If this reads as stupid to you now, it's 5x stupider to watch on screen. Whereas Reese Witherspoon was absolutely believable in her part in the first film, Natasha Lyonne here struggles embodying her character and comes across as trying hard to act like a white trash girl with a dead-end life but does not look credible in the least. Also, Vincent Gallo plays the ""witch"" who is also a cannibal cult leader. He should be entertaining on paper but the way he plays his character, he wears out the welcome really quick.",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ou5zpi/freeway_1996_was_a_blast_to_watch/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ou5zpi/freeway_1996_was_a_blast_to_watch/,Discussion,False,False,False,False,2025-11-11,11,Tuesday

1otsdh9,"November 7-9 Box Office Recap – 'Predator: Badlands' debuts with a great $40M domestically and $79.2M worldwide, the best ever in the franchise. 'Sarah's Oil' and 'Nuremberg' debut solidly with $4.2M and $3.8M. But 'Die My Love' and 'Christy' flop with $2.6M and $1.3M, respectively.",15vcho,SanderSo47,movies,102,0.89,32,1762814324.0,2025-11-10 23:38:44,True,"https://preview.redd.it/ok99bh6mbi0g1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=38e990da9512f2b8d0e742c716a71720383df928

After a very slow October, the box office reignited with the beginning of November.

That was mainly due to ***Predator: Badlands***, which posted the best ever debut in the franchise, showing that this IP still has a lot of life at the box office. The rest of the newcomers, however, were a mixed bag. ***Sarah's Oil*** had a very middling debut, although ***Nuremberg*** over-performed projections. 

The real losers, though, were ***Die My Love*** and ***Christy***. The former had one of the worst ever debuts for Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson, while the latter had one of the worst starts in 2,000 theaters.

The Top 10 earned a combined $74.9 million this weekend. That's up 20.7% from last year, when ***Venom: The Last Dance*** topped the box office for a third week.

Debuting at #1, ***Predator: Badlands*** opened with a great $40 million in 3,725 theaters. That's easily the best debut in the franchise, even dethroning ***Alien vs. Predator*** ($38 million). This debut is also very close to ***Alien: Romulus*** ($42 million) last year.

Even though ***Prey*** and ***Killer of Killers*** were sent to streaming, Disney had enough confidence in the film that they enlisted Dan Trachtenberg to return as director and giving it a theatrical release. To separate itself from the previous installments, the film went on a bigger scale, positioning the Predator to fight large monsters. And despite casting Elle Fanning as co-lead, it was clear that humans were not the focus of the film. 

A few weeks prior, it was revealed that the film would be rated PG-13, the first film in the franchise (excluding ***AvP***) to get it. That led to some disappointment from fans, but the rating did not fundamentally impact the film in a negative way. The rating was mainly because the level of violence wasn't aimed at humans, so the MPAA was a bit lenient in that way. And despite the rating, it still had the reception to justify it; it's sitting at 85% on RT and 71 on Metacritic, which convinced everyone that this is the theatrical ***Predator*** film they were waiting for.

According to 20th Century Studios, 61% of the audience was male. Despite the PG-13 rating, it didn't really benefit much from it; only 11% of the audience was 17 and under. They gave it a great ""A–"" on CinemaScore, the best ever in the franchise. Even with some competition on the way, the film should still hold around the same as ***Romulus***. Which means it should be the franchise's first film to crack $100 million domestically.

***Regretting You*** has kept the second place for the third week in a row. The film eased a very light 15%, adding $6.6 million. The film is clearly showing some damn great legs. The film has earned $38.1 million, and it should finish with over $50 million, which is much better than its early prospects.

In third place, ***Black Phone 2*** eased just 38%, adding $5.1 million this weekend. The film has made $70 million, and it should finish with around $80 million domestically. Not a bad run at all.

In fourth place, Amazon MGM's ***Sarah's Oil*** debuted with a so-so $4.2 million in 2,410 theaters. It's a soft debut, but it's hard to ask for much better numbers here. On some good news, it scored a rare ""A+"" on CinemaScore, which bodes well for its legs.

Coming in over projections, Sony Pictures Classics' ***Nuremberg*** opened with a solid $3.8 million in 1,802 theaters. Its $2,155 per-theater average was also the second best in the Top 10, just behind ***Badlands***. That's a very surprising result, considering that the film didn't have particularly great reviews (69% on RT, 61 on Metacritic) and both Russell Crowe and Rami Malek have struggled in the past few years. Not a bad start, especially compared to two other newcomers we're about to talk about...

***Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc*** is holding surprisingly well for an anime title. It dropped just 45%, for a $3.4 million weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $37.8 million.

Yorgos Lanthimos' ***Bugonia*** added $3.4 million this weekend. That represents a very light 32% drop, signaling some great word of mouth. Through its first 2 weeks in wide release, the film has amassed $12.2 million (Lanthimos' third highest grossing film) and could crack $20 million, assuming it continues holding well.

In eighth place, MUBI's ***Die My Love*** flopped with just $2.6 million in 1,983 theaters. In comparison, MUBI's buzzy title ***The Substance*** earned $3.2 million in 1,949 theaters last year. It's one of the worst ever wide debuts for both Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson.

A film like this was always going to be a tough sell; a film focusing on post-partum depression is not on many moviegoers' minds. Upon premiering in Cannes, MUBI bought the film for a record $24 million (far more than the $12.5 million they spent on acquiring ***The Substance***), which guaranteed at least 1,500 theaters. But it seems like they over-estimated the appeal and its reception; the film is sitting at a 76% on RT, which is solid, but not particularly glowing for an adult drama. It just doesn't have the buzz that ***The Substance*** achieved. So even though MUBI tried an extensive marketing campaign by having many press junkets, the film just didn't attract any interest.

According to MUBI, 51% of the audience was male, and 78% was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a horrible ""D+"" on CinemaScore, signaling toxic word of mouth. Even though Lawrence has gained some buzz for her performance, it's very unlikely the film can last long with this reception. Especially when there's more Oscar contenders coming up. It would be a surprise if ***Die My Love*** made anything above $6 million domestically.

***Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere*** dropped 44% and added $2.1 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $20.3 million, and it will finish with around $25 million domestically.

Rounding out the Top 10 is ***Tron: Ares***. It dropped 40%, grossing $1.8 million. The film has made a meager $71.2 million, and it only has around $5 million left in the gas tank. 

Failing to crack the Top 10 was Black Bear's ***Christy***, starring Sydney Sweeney, which flopped with an abysmal $1.3 million in 2,011 theaters. That's the 13th worst debut for a film playing in 2,000 theaters, and it gets to 11th if we exclude re-releases. That's an abysmal $652 per-theater average.

Despite Sweeney going on a press tour and extensively promoting it, the film just couldn't attract any interest. It was Black Bear's first distributed film, but that just proves the challenge of getting in the theatrical business. The film also lacked an interesting hook or subject matter; Christy Martin may not ring a bell to moviegoers, so they'll be less interested in checking out a biopic. Sweeney's presence has also been marred with controversies over the past months; while it's hard to say it negatively impacted it, it certainly didn't help it. The film's middling reviews (67% on RT) were the nail in the coffin.

Audiences gave ***Christy*** a middling ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which is not a sign of great word of mouth. With zero Oscar buzz, adult dramas coming on its way, and theaters absolutely dropping it with such a pitiful debut, ***Christy*** might struggle to hit $3 million domestically.

Let's cap it off with some great news. Neon released Joachim Trier's ***Sentimental Value*** in 4 theaters, and it debuted with a dazzling $200,031. That's a strong $50,008 per-theater average, which ranks sixth best of the year (fourth best with at least 2 theaters). The film will continue expanding over the next few weeks, hoping to capitalize on some Oscar buzz.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Predator: Badlands*** debuted with $39.2 million overseas, for a great $79.2 million worldwide debut. Like the domestic market, it was the best ever debut for the franchise. The best debuts were in China ($7.4M), UK ($3.2M), Mexico ($2.3M), France ($1.8M) and Japan ($1.7M). China did not over-perform massively like ***Romulus***, but it wasn't expected to do that. From early signs, ***Predator: Badlands*** should easily hit $200 million worldwide, becoming the biggest film in the franchise.

***Regretting You*** added $5.7 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $70.5 million. 

***Black Phone 2*** added $4 million overseas, for a $110 million worldwide total.

***Bugonia*** seems to be showing some small power outside America. It added $3.6 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $23 million. There's still lots of markets left.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEKEND**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Weapons* | Aug/8 | Warner Bros. | $43,501,217 | $151,550,044 | $268,042,500 | $38M
*The Strangers: Chapter 2* | Sep/26 | Lionsgate | $5,806,192 | $15,153,346 | $21,293,765 | $8.5M
*After the Hunt* | Oct/10 | Amazon MGM | $1,529,394 | $3,258,830 | $7,093,629 | $70M-$80M

- Zach Cregger's ***Weapons*** has closed with a fantastic $151 million domestically and $268 million worldwide, far above its $38 million budget. A huge win for original films, and further cementing Cregger as a box office draw (after all, this was sold on his name). Thanks to an incredible marketing campaign, the film was buoyed by great word of mouth (an ""A–"" on CinemaScore, not an easy feat for a horror). Now let's see how his ***Resident Evil*** version does next September.

- Bravo, Renny Harlin. It takes talent to make ***The Strangers: Chapter 2*** fizzle out with just $21 million worldwide. A very underwhelming result, but it's hard to be surprised after the terrible reception to both ***Chapter 1*** and ***Chapter 2***. And there's still another film left to be released. The floor can get lower.

- One of the year's biggest flops, Luca Guadagnino's ***After the Hunt*** has closed with a horrible $3.2 million domestically and $7 million worldwide. For some reason, this cost $70-$80 million, with $20 million going to star Julia Roberts. While the subject matter is challenging, the film's reception did not help it. Originally positioned as a possible Oscar contender, the film shocked many with its Venice premiere, where it earned weak reviews. All buzz went down, and the film vanished without a trace. It marked Guadagnino's latest box office disappointment, and he better hope that his next film fares much better.

#**THIS WEEK**

It's a very busy week, with four films debuting in wide release.

The first is Paramount's ***The Running Man***, the new film from Edgar Wright. Based on the novel by Stephen King, it stars Glen Powell as a man who takes part in a dangerous game show where he must survive 30 days to win money. The trailers have emphasized action and the big scale of the game, which is very important in a blockbuster. Will that be enough to top the box office?

There's also the release of Lionsgate's ***Now You See Me: Now You Don't***, the third installment in the franchise. Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Isla Fisher, and Morgan Freeman reprise their roles, and they're joined by Justice Smith, Dominic Sessa, Ariana Greenblatt, and Rosamund Pike. The franchise has been lucrative for Lionsgate; each film has made over $330 million worldwide. But the franchise halted 9 years ago, which is a long time to release a sequel. Will the audience still show up or they did just move on?

Neon is also releasing Osgood Perkins' new horror film ***Keeper***, which stars Tatiana Maslany and Rossif Sutherland. Perkins is responsible for two of Neon's highest grossing films, ***Longlegs*** and ***The Monkey***, so he's riding on some good will with the audience. With ***Black Phone 2*** slowing down, could this be a main attraction for horror fans?

And finally, A24 is releasing ***Eternity***, starring Miles Teller, Elizabeth Olsen, Callum Turner. The film follows a woman who must choose between two men with whom to spend eternity in the afterlife.

I like movies from the 1910s-1959 and usually the male and female love-interests in a monster movie, sci-fi movie, or film noir get a happily ever after. Often the woman is heavily involved in what's going on, usually because she's a journalist or a writer. The stereotype of a woman just standing there and getting kidnapped in movies of that era is not really a thing. Slashers didn't exist but there were still things to overcome. For instance, in the 1930s The Most Dangerous Game, people are getting picked off one by one and our heroes are trying to escape in the jungle.

So what do you think constitutes a Final Girl?

Is she one if her love-interest is also alive at the end?

Is she one if she's the monster and she's alive at the end?

Either the twist is predictable, or only surprising for the sake of being surprising with previous scenes designed to mislead rather than foreshadow or make sense. It’s even harder to make a re-watchable film that centres on a twist ending.

I just rewatched The Others (2001), and imo it’s a rare case of all these things and more - I wish it was talked about more.

Now it’s one of my favourite films — not as a horror movie, but as what it reveals itself to be only after knowing the end: an incredibly sad and powerful tragedy about grief, loss and a mother coming to terms with a devastating truth.

After you know that truth, the whole film changes and every single scene hits different with this framing. Moments that made you confused, suspicious or scared on the first watch become just devastatingly sad - people say it's a horror film and it was scary for me as a kid but over all my viewings it has made me cry far more than it made me scared. 

Nicole Kidman's performance is amazing but can only truly be appreciated on second viewing. Every single scene takes on a completely different meaning with the framing of the ending and you start to notice all the subtle moments which foreshadow this in her performance. The scene where she describes limbo; she is literally on the verge of tears as she says ""pain forever"" - on first watch its interpreted as a strictly devout mother terrified of the idea of hell, but when you rewatch it you realise she’s describing her new reality — she’s in limbo, and she is terrified. 

Also the score composed by the director himself is one of my all time favourites, rich and deeply emotionally evocative, moving and sad.  Its a way of hinting all along this is a tragedy rather than horror. When Grace is reunited with her husband Charles, the scene is accompanied with one of the saddest tracks in the whole score. What would usually be an uplifting moment of joy is instead given this deep mournful cello melody because this isn't a happy moment. It's Charles realising that his wife and children are dead and he is too. 

In the scene where Grace does tell the children what happened the score is almost perfectly projected onto her words and emotions - it starts devastatingly sad as she realises that she killed her children. The score then rises into a tiny glimmer of hope as she says ""then I heard you playing with the pillows as if nothing had happened - ahh I thought the lord in his great mercy, was giving me another chance"". Just masterfully done - the track is called ""Good Mother"". That last scene is the best bit of acting by Nicole in anything and always moves me to tears.

I know this is unpopular and will probably get some downvotes, but for me, Temple Of Doom has always been my favorite and still is. Raiders is a very close second. I enjoy the other three as well and find they're interchangable and my placement varies depending on my mood. I find the other three have their ups and downs.

* Last Crusade - More nostalgia for this than the latter two sequels from catching it non-stop on the USA Network back then. Enjoy the interplay between Indy and his father which is no doubt the high point. The boat, motorcycle and tank scenes are awesome , I dig the Grail trials and the Grail theme is among my favorite pieces of music from the series. But it's too repetitive of Raiders with the Nazis again, I hate what it does to Brody and Sallah, and the villains are the dullest of the series for me. Not a fan of the more family-friendly tone compared with the more Horror-like TOD. Plus for some reason this one just isn't as rewatchable. I rarely watch it unless marathoning the entire series.

* Crystal Skull - Great seeing Indy back and Ford shows even older he still has it as the character. Enjoyed having Marion back, Spalko is a cool villain, the Crystal Skull is a neat relic and I like the 1950s backdrop and how the UFO and red scare zeitgeist is reflected. But it's got too much CGI which at times makes it feel video game-y, Mac and Oxley are both utterly useless and the film feels like it would've been significantly improved without them. It also probably arguably took a decade too long to get made. Much like TLC, another I usually only watch when marathoning the entire series.

* Dial Of Destiny - Great having Indy back a final time. The dial itself is a neat artifact, Voller is the best villain since Mola Ram. I enjoyed the chemistry between Indy, Helena and Teddy, which gave me some strong TOD vibes. But much like 4, it felt like to came too far too late and it's obvious with Harrison's much older age it was never going to be an action-intensive film. And like the two before it, somewhat low on the rewatchability barring a marathon.

A classic series for sure. I get Raiders being the best in many ways but TOD for me is the most entertaining. My very first Indy film and what an introduction to the world of Indiana Jones at the age I saw it at. An all-around amazing series and I'm glad we got a fifth and final film. The fifth wasn't perfect but I think it was as good as could've been coming so many years later and was a solid series finale.

It can be about forgetting something, but it can also be about thinking that said thing was different to what it ultimately was. For example, you could misremember a film's ending as stopping on a pretty good final shot, but it turns out that the film keeps going after that and has a weaker denouement. 

I can think of one example, and sadly it's not a movie but a TV show. South Park has the episode ""Butters's Bottom Bitch"" and in it, there's a subplot about Officer Harrison Yates's hilariously overly committed yet obviously inept attempts at going undercover as a prostitute called Yolanda, one that works on several unwitting people. 

I had a memory of him, when revealing himself pulling out a gun and going ""FREEZE! I'M ACTUALLY A COP!"" and laughing at how funny it is that this very obvious undercover cop has to announce on the people he tricked that he's ""actually a cop"". Plus it just sounds funny to say that you're ""actually a X""

Then I rewatched the episode and sadly he doesn't say that, the closest at the end is when he goes ""I'M A COP!"".

Like right now.

 But if you have…

I think it’s a massive backfire.

Or maybe I’m just a cynical old fart. But hear me out.

The movie on its face appears to be a searing indictment of capitalism and how bloody awful life is for most people in America.

Over 60% of people are struggling to make ends meet. The American Dream is pretty much dead for the majority.

When we start out, Aziz’s character has the shittiest life. Awful task rabbit jobs, sleeping in his car, no money, no anything.

In contrast Seth has everything. Tech bro billionaire, huge house, $250k watches. 

It becomes a kind of body swap movie. Keanu, as the guardian angel, lets Aziz experience life as Seth, and vice versa. So that Aziz can truly appreciate that his godawful life is worth living. 

To swap back, he has to genuinely believe there’s hope for him. 

And he does.

Which blew my mind. The moral of the story should have been that life really does favor the lucky and the rich, and life is also fundamentally unfair.

Instead we’re told that hey, it’s ok to have a job as a delivery driver for Amazon where you piss in bottles, have no money for anything other than bills, and generally live from paycheck to payback eating ramen and scraping the couch cushions for a quarter. Because at least you’re you and you have your girlfriend.

And rich assholes, well they’ll see the true value in people and fight for the average joes. 

I mean… Doesn’t that seem like some crazy propaganda? Don’t complain about what little you have, the ultra rich life isn’t all that. 

Ummm… it is. Money may not be able to buy happiness, but it sure as hell makes life a whole lot easier. I haven’t seen my parents in ten years. Can’t afford intentional travel. That would be nice. But then again, it’s great that I never eat out at restaurants and go thrifting to flip stuff on eBay. That’s the good stuff. 

Like I said, maybe I’m cynical. I can see what the intention was but my God, it smacked me in the face at the end.

How does Neil McCauley (Robert de Niro), who is shown throughout the film to be utterly meticulous and deeply cautious, allow Waingro (Kevin Gage), who is shown to be a serial rapist and murderer (not to mention a loose cannon, literally), to join his crew for the heist at the beginning of the movie?

It's an unmotivated/inexplicable action by McCauley, and it feels a bit sheisty that Mann starts the script only *after* Waingro has already joined the crew. It's not like he does some critical, irreplaceable job for them that it would be reasonable to take a risk with. Without some additional reasoning, such as when the crew takes a risk with driver Don Breenan (Dennis Haysbert) when under extreme time pressure, the whole thing with Waingro, and therefore much of the film's core narrative, seems totally out of character for McCauley.

I've watched Heat dozens of times, I can quote the screenplay title to title from memory and, as I said, I think this is one of the best crime films ever made... but it may be built on a paper-thin foundation, unless I've missed something.

1ougcqe,A few thoughts on The Truman Show after a rewatch,cqsdn,Mnemosense,movies,0,0.37,16,1762883741.0,2025-11-11 18:55:41,True,"I haven't seen this movie in about a decade, I swear it gets scarier every time I revisit it. Anyway, I had a few thoughts on this recent rewatch.  

1] Christof is one of the most evil villains in cinema history. I truly believe that. He won't get mentioned in Most Evil Villains lists due to having no kill count. But what this guy does is monstrous. To control someone's life to that extent, to induce actual traumatic phobias in them to prevent them to leave, it's actually insane.   

Most of us in the very last scene of the movie would have gone on a delirious rant full of rage at the world, or screamed at Christof to go fuck himself. Truman however is a unique individual. The guy can find humour in the most dire situation, and in that moment manages to have the composure to sign off with his catchphrase.  

Not only does he beat Christof by robbing the director's life of meaning (which for the past several decades has solely been to be god to Truman), but he also doesn't give Christof what he wants, which is to make a scene that will draw ratings. He just throws a regurgitated line back at him and disappears.  

2] Truman accomplishes his lifelong dream of being an explorer when he walks through that door. Everything he's ever learned in his life has no doubt been sanitised and censored. There are countries out there he has no idea exist, wars he doesn't know that have happened, technology he has no idea about. He doesn't even know about the internet! (at least there's no evidence of it in the movie's town)  

I've seen many comments over the years by people who think his life is going to be depressing, but I disagree. He's shown us how resilient he is, and I think having become an explorer he will live his life to the fullest. No matter how rough things will get while being the most famous person on the planet, at least he will be surrounded by people who are not acting. Even people, like paparazzi, being rude to him will amuse him.  

I guess you could make a dark sequel about him spiralling into paranoia, not knowing what's real anymore (i.e - am I in a matrix within a matrix?), but I prefer the happy ending which is in line with the movie's triumphant tone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ougcqe/a_few_thoughts_on_the_truman_show_after_a_rewatch/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ougcqe/a_few_thoughts_on_the_truman_show_after_a_rewatch/,Discussion,False,False,False,False,2025-11-11,18,Tuesday

1ouiih8,An Older Fan Edit of Blade Runner and My Preferred Cut,728avqwq,Neet2155,movies,0,0.22,0,1762888392.0,2025-11-11 20:13:12,True,"Definitive Version of Blade Runner (For me)...

Please skip to the final paragraph if you don't want to read my giant and boring wall of text (2nd to last paragraph prior to the ""Edit"").



I have known about Blade Runner since I was barely an adult. Looking at that cool og cover many years ago, I thought I was in for something super sci-fi and crazy epic adventure. I wasn't really prepared for what I had watched. 

Although I can't recall which exact version it was, the film didn't work for me. But over the years, I had come to appreciate it's influence on the Sci-fi and Cyber-Punk genre. If you were to ask me a week ago as to what I appreciated about Blade Runner, I would most likely say the atmosphere, music, and how human the concept is (Replicants not being machines and simply wanting to live). Flashforward to today, I recently got a hold of a particular cut of the movie...mind you, I have only ever seen the Final Cut a handful of times. Prior to this and I had no idea what I was in store for. 

The Fan Edit cut, known simply as The Electric Unicorn Edition (or Cut), contains the narration which you have the option to remove. I don't believe it uses the Final Cut's remastered footage, but the remastered from the 90s dvd releases. It also contain ALL the deleted footage as part of the film, optional subtitles included, as well as the Unicorn dream sequence, and the ""Happy Ending"" after the credits. 

I watched the film for the first time with my wife, who's first language is not English, and with my father, who had seen the Final Cut with me a few years back (He didn't like it). This particular version is well over two hours, and I have included the narration during this watch. Not many agree with this, especially Ridley Scott himself, but the way the film flows from scene to scene, couple in the visual atmosphere, and Deckard's narration, particularly where he is studying the documents of the replicants, really gave me Apocalypse Now vibes. It also, more than it ever did for me in the past, felt like a true sci-fi neo noir mystery thriller. Both my wife and father enjoyed the film. 

Like most noir films (Chinatown, The Third man, Touch of Evil, and LA Confidential), just about every piece of the puzzle comes together nicely. The investigation and build up to the Zohra encounter felt much smoother, especially over the course of the narration and Deckard investigating the ""fish"" scale in the apartment, later finding out, while eating at his Ramen place, that it was in fact Snake scale, thus bringing him closer to Zohra. The extra emphasis placed on Gaff's origamis in every scene, as well as his attitude towards Deckard and the Nexus 6 case is also made more clear in this version. Leon's entire arc for being an undercover spy for Batty and showcasing heavy emotions, confusing Holdom who would later warn Deckard that they're a new breed of Replicants. Leon hiding in a closet and being visually upset when both Deckard and Gaff had taken the photos places a much greater emphasis on how ""memories"" are the only things that Replicants hold dear, despite it being a ""beautiful lie"".  

You also get more of an outlook from characters such as Bryant, Gaff, and Holdom. During the second and final visit in the hospital, any emotions or feelings Deckard may have had towards retiring Zohra or any romantic involvement he had with Rachel, Holdom dismisses it as simple pleasure, asking if he ""fucked skinjob or not"", with it being intentionally unclear whether he was referring to a dead Zohra or Rachel, making the scene somewhat sad and disturbing. Although we are shown this in the Final Cut, Deckard is visibly distraught, disturbed, and hurt for what he is doing to the Replicants, despite harboring similar feelings of disdain towards them. His visits with Holdom, narration, drinking, and him checking Rachel out in the washroom while washing away injuries sustained from his encounter with Leon, showcase all these emotions, and his inner refusal to accept them as humans...at first. 

Rachel rescuing him, his encounter with Zohra, Leon, and Roy Batty, given everything we've learned up to this point, has had a profound impact on him, and all the extra scenes with Bryant Holdon, and especially Gaff, tend to show who the ""real animals"" are. During Roy Batty's final moments, although not a favorite, you get a deeper understanding of what goes on in Deckard's mind and how he ""watched as he slowly died"". This scene so clearly brought things full circle. Replicant's, particularly Batty and his comrades, loved life. Something everyone else took for advantage. Gaff's chilling words, ""..are you even a man"" are spouted out, hinting to the very famous theory that fans have come to expect. The other hint, outside of the Unicorn dream and the Origami that Gaff leaves behind in Deckard's apartment, is ironically in the ""Happy Ending"" where Rachel would say to Deckard, prior to a fade to black, ""you and I are MADE from each other"". Quite interesting but I don't really care too much for any of the"" is he"" or ""isn't he"". 

The Electric Unicorn Edition has become my favorite and definitive version of Blade Runner and is now ranked amongst my all time favorite movies. I have burnt the file to a DVD and placed it in my Final Cut case alongside the 4k/Bluray discs. I shall watch it from time to time, dissecting more and more and I would like for more people to watch this version and tell me what they think...if interested, please DM me and I can connect you with the individual who transferred me the file. If possible, I would like for more people to watch this version and perhaps one day, we can request an official release because a film like this needs one in all its glory...not just as deleted scenes but one cohesive film. 

Edit: Apologies, I just want to make something clear so as to avoid any confusion. There are zero ""new VFX"" shots included in this film. Nothing in this film is ""new"" or ""created"" by the individual who made the edit. The footage used is from the 1980 movie and it has been enhanced slightly, but that's it. This cut was made back in 2009...It's the longest and ""purest"" unofficial cut in existence. DM me if interested.

1ouevnl,Just because a character is traumatized/hurt doesn't mean they get a pass for their wrongs! The Whale: Ellie Discussion,capdgc02,GP-NC,movies,0,0.28,4,1762880512.0,2025-11-11 18:01:52,True,"I have just watched the movie ""The Whale"" for the first time! I know I'm about 3-4 years late.

What got me was this character! Ellie, her name is. I read a lot of discussion posts on the movie and her. Most of them are excusing her behavior because of her past, some even siding with her.

Well, I was surprised to tell you the truth. So for 1 hour I collected my thoughts and wished to put into context why I believe her character is still evil despite her being traumatized. 

This is an open discussion so fill free to post your hot takes, disagreements, or even tell me I'm wrong if you believe it.



\-----------------  


Anyway, enough of that. 

This character in my opinion is bad, realistic yes, but I don't like her. Here is why!

  
Her charges include:

  
**Most serious charges:**

1. Drugging a man (her father)
2. Peer pressuring Thomas to relapse/do weed
3. [Threatening a false report of a class A felony (Threatening to tell the cops Thomas raped her so she could get him to smoke) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mBtmCy2GrQ&t=2m20s)

**Mild charges:**

1. Slashing teachers tires
2. [Recording and picturing others (sometimes) without consent and posting it without their knowledge](https://www.mwl-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/RECORDING-CONVERSATIONS-CHART.pdf)

**Minor charges:**

1. Making her father do all her essays and only care about the money
2. Just being rude



Now for all of these charges I want to nail the head of the coffin. Many say that because she was abandoned at a young age, has an alcoholic mom, she is not evil.

Just because someone had a traumatic past doesn't make them do all of this. It is a possible reason, but many trauma survivors don't drug a man in their own house.

  
Being traumatized doesn't give her the right or excuse her behavior in any way!

  
Here are some comments I found to debate:

>Ellie is not evil. She is in pain and acts out in anger and rage. Charlie is in pain and uses avoidance and food. Ex-wife is in pain and uses alcohol and lacks self awareness. Liz is in pain and is an enabler. Thomas is in pain and uses weed, stealing and lying. This movie is a great example of what unhealed trauma looks like and how it bleeds into our relationship with self and all of our relationships with others.

  
I understand that she is troubled. But being in pain doesn't excuse drugging a man or threatening rape. 

>Having psychological trauma as a kid for being abandoned by your dad and living with an alcoholic mom, and having hurt and pain which causes you to be a more cynical person automatically makes you an evil person?  
  
Congratulations, you’re an unsympathetic dumbass.

  
No, it doesn't. But she has done things that make her seem like an evil person.

1osqwsp,Materialists was a bafflingly frustrating movie,10l8ne,bitchcraffft,movies,403,0.83,320,1762713323.0,2025-11-09 19:35:23,True,"(Contains spoilers)

I watched Materialists last night and I’m still mad about it so I came here to vent. I love Pedro Pascal but I’m not really a romance/romcom fan so I waited to watch it on streaming and boy I’m glad I didn’t pay the cost of a movie ticket. 

Why was every character and shot so flat and lifeless and one-dimensional? Why couldn’t this movie pick a tone? Did they think we wouldn’t get the moral of the story after seventeen different monologues about how “love isn’t about checking boxes”? Who thought it was a good idea to have a poorly handled SA-themed plot twist 2/3 into the movie that seems only to serve as a “lesson” for the deeply unlikeable protagonist? 

The editing was also so bizarre. There was no reason for this movie to be two hours long and a lot of the scenes felt like there was some kind of time quota they were trying to reach. And in that time, most of the characters don’t go through any meaningful development and in some cases even end up going right back to making choices that the movie already made a point to show didn’t work the first time. 

What’s wild to me is that the press tour for this movie was delightful and proved these people absolutely can have chemistry together but none of that was present in the actual film. 

I haven’t watched Past Lives so I don’t know if this is a director problem or a this movie problem but…yikes.

And while there are “only” 9 minutes added, along with some mild scene shuffling (in both cases mostly in the beginning), those both give a ton of added context to the plot as a whole, and to specific scenes, and address many of the typical complaints with the film.

Check out the trailer here: [https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/train-dreams-trailer-joel-edgerton](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/train-dreams-trailer-joel-edgerton)  

SYNOPSIS: Based on the beloved novella by Denis Johnson, Train Dreams is the moving portrait of Robert Grainier (Golden Globe nominee Joel Edgerton), whose life unfolds during an era of unprecedented change in early 20th-century America. Orphaned at a young age, Robert grows into adulthood among the towering forests of the Pacific Northwest, where he helps expand the nation’s railroad empire alongside men as unforgettable as the landscapes they inhabit. After a tender courtship, he marries Gladys (Academy Award nominee Felicity Jones) and they build a home together, though his work often takes him far from her and their young daughter. When his life takes an unexpected turn, Robert finds beauty, brutality, and newfound meaning in the forests and trees he has felled. An ode to a vanishing way of life, an ever-evolving world, and to the extraordinary possibilities that exist within even the most simple of existences, Train Dreams captures a time and place that are now long gone, and the people who built a bridge to a future they could only dream of. Directed by Academy Award nominee Clint Bentley with a screenplay by Bentley and Academy Award nominee Greg Kwedar, the writing team behind Sing Sing, the film also stars Academy Award nominees William H. Macy and Kerry Condon.

1ot2y6e,"The Last of the Mohicans: Alice and Uncas, unlike anything in cinematic history",1z163on66l,Reasonable_Pea_6287,movies,24,0.68,9,1762744135.0,2025-11-10 04:08:55,True,"First, I’m sorry if I’m at all repetitive (and long!) but this is practically therapeutic because this is something that has bothered me for years. So here it is… 

Alice and Uncas are two of the most interesting characters in cinema to me, they are each so compelling and intriguing. And the love story of Alice and Uncas is one of the most powerful, beautiful, and captivating love stories of all time. Ok I’ll say it… THE most, in my personal opinion. But what is so amazing about it is, it was given barely any time and they were given barely any dialog! But they didn’t even need it… The fact that they are two of the most compelling characters and one of the most haunting and captivating love stories while also being the most neglected characters and love story, is absolutely incredible! 
To the actors Jodhi May as Alice and Eric Schweig as Uncus, the depth and level of acting that went into accomplishing this is so great I wouldn’t know where to begin, making this an example of some of the most underrated acting in history. 

There are so many adoring fans of these characters and their love story that there are tributes to them online. If you read what people write  under YouTube videos, etc., there are a lot of insightful and beautiful comments about Alice and Uncas.  It’s funny because many of us see the same things about them and it was all delivered solely on eyes/body language and whatever else you want to call it. It serves as proof that the best acting comes from within and that there is a greater depth to things such that, with the right writing/acting/directing, can actually successfully be captured even without words or narrative. 
Truly one of the most beautiful things in cinema that captivated and haunted much of its audience, and all of this from essentially having to try to catch the quick glimpses of them in this film. I’ve never witnessed anything like it. Their characters and story overcame and conquered their own neglect so powerfully that they outshined the stars, at least to many of us. 
I say neglect based on focus and time, but certainly not neglect in the intricate detail of their scenes and sheer quality in every detail in them. 

Alice is perhaps the most neglected (by way of time and focus) character I’ve ever seen considering her level of depth. I tried so very hard to favor the focused-on main female, Cora. I really tried to watch this through the lens we were supposed to: Cora and Hawkeye being the stars and the epic love story. It just didn’t work. There was something missing. Yes, I like both their characters a lot, yes I like that they were in love, but it didn’t move me like it was supposed to and although Cora had some great lines and very cool scenes that normally make it easy for me to find favoritism, Alice exceeded her… There is just something about her. And her final scene proves it. 
Alice’s character has so much intense, unexplored depth that makes you want to learn more about her. When she leaves a scene, you want to follow, but never get to. She’s much more mysterious than Cora, not for lack of dialog but simply from her tone, gazes, and other subtleties. Her scenes are so short and so few, but so intense that they are literally haunting. The amount of unexplored depth about her is something I could go on and on about. 
You see glimpses of such courage from her early on, like when she went to get closer to view the enemies but Uncus stopped her to keep her safe—some have called Uncas her silent protector. And her final moment is one of the most powerful scenes in cinematic history and shows that she was a character of so much beauty, love, strength, courage, and profound conviction… It is one of the top most impactful scenes in cinema. 

Alice is also so incredibly beautiful. She is breathtakingly beautiful… Both actresses are unmistakably gorgeous, but when Alice’s hair comes down, her beauty steals the show. I can’t take my eyes off her. This says a lot given the fact that Madeleine is so beautiful. Btw, they make incredible sisters. 

Alice as she’s about to throw herself off the cliff is literally one of the most beautiful images I have ever seen. 

Again, do not get me wrong, both are incredibly beautiful. 

Uncus…

Uncus is such a strong, stoic, brave, protective, cool, heroic, great character. Like with Alice, I could go on and on. Yes he is incredibly handsome! but this is only one of the reasons he is one of the most attractive male characters I’ve ever seen. The level of depth and feeling acted with his eyes… you can see him seeing something in and feeling so deeply for Alice in the scene where he watches her from a distance, without ever needing dialog to express it. Just one example of many. His level of depth is similar to Alice’s. You can see so much feeling and intensity coming from him with absolutely no words. And in his light hearted moments, his smile is just so great and there is just something about him that I’d have to write like three other paragraphs to convey or at least try to convey.
He was so great to watch and there were so unjustifiably few scenes focused on him, but where they were, you couldn’t get enough. 

With Uncas and Alice, I’ve never seen such levels of depth solely from within. Usually this has to be conveyed with words, with them, no words were necessary and the acting translated this to screen! Again, so incredible. 

Their love was so true, pure, and a true soul connection. It developed naturally and powerfully with the pure and authentic language of feeling. This was a unique masterpiece in every regard. 
It was also one of the most swoon-worthy, romantic, exciting, and beautiful—so absolutely beautiful—love stories I’ve ever witnessed. 

I wish I had saved what I read others wrote about their character interactions that people have noticed, because they pointed out so many beautiful and insightful things about the interactions between these two, that, given what little screen time they got, might go unnoticed. (There are 3 cuts so not sure if every cut has all these little moments shown. One example is in the directors expanded edition—not to be mistaken with the final directors cut which I actually prefer—when they get into the canoe after the attack, Cora is holding Alice’s arm to direct her to follow her but Alice pulls away and purposefully goes to sit with Uncas. After someone pointed it out I finally noticed but it was in the directors expanded edition I just watched so I can’t say if it’s in all of them, but hopefully.) What scenes they had together were so moving and intense, though. And even the tiny, easy-to-miss subtleties throughout the film were so precious, those are some of the things others have pointed out in things like YouTube comments. 

The waterfall scene is one of the most beautiful and romantic scenes I have ever seen in my life. And the way he was willing to give his life to try to save her in spite of impossible odds was so profoundly moving. Alice at one point without a second thought  tries to go to Uncus’s aid and presumably fight Magua, showing an incredible amount of love and courage, but the other tribe members held her back.
Alice was such a haunting character. It’s like she was too beautiful for all the ugliness of the world (and she’s always drawn to the beautiful things, like gazing at the waterfall when they were climbing up the rock and captivated by the waterfall in the cave) and it impacted her so deeply that you could see she would go to this deep, internal place of so much sadness that she didn’t seem to mind to leave this place, like in the behind-the-waterfall scene, but then Uncas pulled her back and held her so lovingly and so deeply and it’s as if his love gave her something good and beautiful to hold onto in this world. When he died for her, she loved him so much that her hope died with him, and with no self-pity at all, rather than be taken as essentially a slave and rather than just surviving without her love, she chose to go with him and end her own life. It’s like her heart was already thrown off the cliff, she just followed. And like Uncas’s selfless rescue of her, she showed such incredible bravery and all that unexplored depth hit the audience so powerfully that this scene, her character, Uncas’s character, and their love story, haunts the audience to this date.
Plus the sheer level of conviction, her eyes at Magua after slaying her love… that was the most badass thing in the movie which is saying a lot. In fact, it is one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen. At that point it was like she was a phoenix, and the most evil man in the movie that rose hell, had zero power over her. It was the first time Magua showed any kind of vulnerability and even fear in the entire film. 
Others have also suggested, based on the way he lowered his knife and looked genuinely concerned, that he saw in Alice in this moment, what Uncas saw in her. I definitely see something there along those lines. 

Back to Alice/Uncas… There is a sort of epic, action/adventure Romeo and Juliet thing to them, but much more profound, deeper and more beautiful. 

So, try as I did, I could not be swept away by Cora and Nathaniel (Hawkeye). Alice and Uncus outshined them for me against even my own will. Both on their own as individual characters, and their relationship. 

So, while this is one of my all time favorite movies, it always left me so deeply unsatisfied and bothered because we just didn’t get enough of the ones so many of us were captivated by and argue are the greatest characters and love story and it always made Cora/Nathaniel feel rather forced to me personally. But we might have seen more! It turns out there was a beautiful love scene of Alice and Uncas that was cut out and I did read it suggested in an interview that some of the reasoning was because director Michael Mann wanted the focus to be on “the stars” and their love story. It’s not even available to the public online which is insane to me and so annoying. Michael Mann did an amazingly brilliant job with this movie but I disagree with his choice to delete the love scene between Alice and Uncas. And I wish they would AT LEAST make the deleted scenes available to see online. 

The deleted love scene…

The waterfall scene was longer… They have a secret love and commitment to one another. In the scene that was filmed and cut out, Uncas and Alice kiss and there was also a scene, still in that setting I believe, where Alice braids her hair or Uncas braids Alice’s hair which is a sign of love and commitment (I’ll post below the meaning of the braid). That is why her hair is braided after the waterfall scene!! That is so incredibly beautiful. (In the past I remember wondering why her hair was suddenly braided.) In fact, it was originally written that when Uncas grabs her and holds her, they actually make love, but because Johdi’s mother was on set and Johdi was 17, her mom didn’t want her to do that scene so they rewrote it to where it just contained a kiss and that is the scene they filmed. 

To me, Nathaniel and Cora were more manufactured where Alice and Uncas happened so naturally, beautifully, raw and authentically. 

And apparently there were a lot of cut Uncas scenes which to me is annoying because Uncas was such an incredible character, a legit Mohican, and more scenes with him would have been amazing to see as well as more scenes (assuming they exist which I think is a relatively safe assumption) of him and his brother Hawkeye together and of their dad. 

But anyway, Uncas and Alice were each separately so compelling and their relationship so extraordinarily compelling. 

I have read that there is an original 3 hour version, if that is true, I really wish they would release the original 3 hour version with all the Uncas scenes and the love scene between he and Alice. People were even talking about starting a petition to do so years back. 

In an interview, I read Eric say that the love scene between him and Alice should not have been cut out. He also alludes to his disappointment that a lot of his scenes were cut, but never comes across as angry or critical and remains gracious, professional, and respectful. The website with that interview has the name Mohican in it but I don’t remember the full site name. 

And a special shout out to Duncan… when he translated HIS life rather than Hawkeye’s to the Huron chief, that was SO powerful and moving and heartbreakingly beautiful!

(I am part Huron so I don’t exactly love the depiction of the Huron in the movie lol, but hey.) 

Truly an incredible movie but so much tragically and unjustifiably missed!

Please understand I really like Cora and Hawkeye’s characters a lot. I just don’t get the same level of depth from them as I do Uncas and Alice, but some of Nathaniel’s (Hawkeye’s) lines are my favorite. 
It did annoy me a bit that Cora didn’t try to just steal a key from a British soldier to unlock Hawkeye and allow him to escape rather than be hanged, though, because I don’t think it would have been that hard for her to get, that made no sense to me, I figure maybe she was going to do something but they were attacked and all that before she had the opportunity? In any case I knew his brother and dad were going to get him out of it, but I digress. 

I also want to note, Alice could have jumped before Uncas died. She was instead being held and led against her will but surviving because she had hope and something to hold on for. When she saw her love die, her heart was broken and she refused to take the hand of the man who killed him. She chose to go with her love. Overall it showed an incredible amount of strength, courage, love and again, profound conviction. Same with Uncas going to her rescue. 

When Uncas and Alice first meet, she yells at him about the horses and he grabs onto her, she suddenly calms and stares at him as if captivated, and he, instead of just stopping her from going after the horses, stops and stares into her eyes. The moment is brief and not in the main focus, but they were captivated by each other from the beginning. And there are so many of these intricate moments with them throughout the entire film if you pay attention like others have pointed out. I mean you’re looking past the main focus points to get a glimpse of characters that were—until the end—pushed to the side. That says a lot. And you’re looking past the main focus points and seeing the most deep and amazing love story unfold while it’s somewhat imo purposefully being pushed aside. That says a lot. I actually think audiences would have appreciated the Cora/Nathaniel story more if we got a fair share of the other main characters and what was happening, that is certainly true for me and someone else suggested as much on this site. 
So imagine how many other moments we would have seen, even without the cut love scene. And overall, I am really upset at the cut Uncas scenes in general and would love to see them, he was my favorite male character. And I imagine that the Mohican father had cut scenes, too. I would have loved to have seen more scenes of the actual Mohicans and think we should have. That being said, Nathaniel was awesome. Again, I would have  loved to see him interact more with his brother, Uncas, I loved them as brothers. But sorry I think I’m being really repetitive now. 

Again, I really wish they would release the complete, full 3 hour version. It’s too good not to. I mean you could argue there’s not technically a complete version. I don’t know whether or not there is but I do know there were a lot of deleted scenes so I would absolutely love to see a much longer version of this. And having more than three (there are presently three) cuts of this movie is warranted because it’s so great. But AT LEAST make the deleted love scene and braid scenes available to the public online please! 

As for the braiding of the hair… I read people on a Mohican‘s website and some other places talk about how the braid signified a connection and commitment. So I actually just quickly googled it and this is what showed up from AI: 

A couple braiding hair in Native American culture symbolizes a deep connection, love, and unity, with the three strands often representing the body, mind, and spirit.

* Union and connection: The three strands of a braid represent the body, mind, and spirit, and braiding them together symbolizes the harmonious union of a couple in all aspects. It can also represent their connection to each other, their family, and the earth. 
* Nurturing and care: The act of braiding is an intimate gesture of care, affection, and respect. It's a way for a partner to show support and love, and to pass on positive energy and strength to each other. 
* Strength and resilience: Individual strands of hair can be weak, but when braided together, they become strong. A couple braiding hair can symbolize how they are stronger together than they are apart, representing the strength of their bond. 
* Shared history and future: Hair is seen as a repository of memories and experiences. Braiding is a way to share and weave together their life stories, and to embark on a new journey with shared purpose and strength
Sacredness: In many Indigenous cultures, hair is considered sacred and connected to a person's identity and life force. The act of a couple braiding each other's hair can elevate this sacred practice to a shared, spiritual experience.

His horse is black. There’s a gang that is terrorizing the town and the leader wants this girl, she’s like platinum blonde wearing a baby blue dress or a stripe blue and white dress, she’s super innocent. Her father might have been a bar owner or a tailor of the town but he’s quite timid. The town was so afraid they were willing to give her up. But the protagonist isn’t going to let it happen. 

The one thing that stands out is, he doesn’t have the “jaded past” persona. He seems kind, gives off like a superman vibe if you get what I mean. He promises to deliver the girl to the villain man but as bait and the plans on taking him out. The girl of course falls for him. The villain is a demeaning, drunk, womanizer. I think later on natives come in as another antagonist in the film but I didn’t get a chance to finish the film.

So at the :21 second mark of the original trailer for Raiders, there is footage of what seems to be (given the context of the narrative in the trailer) the opening of the Well of the Souls that is very much not the footage from the film.  (I express it that way about the context because it COULD be footage of the map room being discovered that was never used in the final film...)

I wonder what the story is with this?  Was it possibly a reshoot because the moving of the stone ""door"" looks less than impressive...but they hadn't reshot by the time the trailer needed to be out?

Also - and I know the trailer is pretty low quality - the trailer makes it seem like the face of the tall statue is clear the moment the stone is pulled away...but in the final version, it is more played as a reveal when the lightning lights up the face.  I wonder if that was a ""we need another thrill moment"" from Spielberg in the similar vein to Ben Gardiner's head in the boat in  Jaws...

I really enjoyed the film it’s a very weird erotic horror film, it’s a vampire film but a very different take on vampires were it’s not your lead vampire preying on their victim sinking their fangs into them and drinking their blood. David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve’s characters slash their victims with an Egyptian pendant and then dispose their victims bodies in an incinerator. The look of the film screams 80s by the white lighting, the hairstyles. David Bowie I thought did a good job and the makeup done on him to look old and decrepit I thought were very well done you don’t actually could tell that it’s him.

This is only the second time I’ve rewatched it, but I remember enjoying the movie the first time in the early 2000s. Here are some observations:

1. Tom Hanks can play a bad guy — albeit a principled bad guy. But the prosthetic nose seemed unnecessary to me. 

2. The actor who played Michael did a credible job and looks like a young Ray Liotta (minus the blue eyes; RIP). 

3. Paul Newman was still bringing the heat, just a few years before his death. I liked his choice of a vague Irish brogue — after all, he’s been living in America for many years presumably. His piano duet with Hanks was incredible, setting up the triangle with Newman’s bio son without any dialogue.

When he chastises his son in front of his mob captains, he bangs his hand HARD on the table. At his advanced age! 

4. Daniel Craig epitomized the entitled, soft brat of a son. 

5. Jennifer Jason Leigh was underutilized. 

And here’s the performance that stole the film…

6. Jude Law was the original Night Crawler, right? On my second viewing, I noticed he was styled like Nosferatu (balding, disgusting teeth with long, dirty nails). He was absolutely ghoulish. 

Law’s diner performance with Tom Hanks was some really fine acting. Memorably fine.

Yeah, you still get to be usual violence and shock value and really fantastic conversation, 
great music (very catchy Across 110th Street),  and the other typical signs of Tarantino signature style, but at the heart of it, Jackie Brown it’s a pretty mature film. I mean it’s about getting older and about connection betweena middle-age woman trying to survive in a messed up sexist and racist world and an older guy who feels lonely.

I like that there are so many moments where you’re just kind of watching the characters and you have time to really reflect on things. It’s not like nonstop action. Nothing against nonstop action of course, but the character study is quite fascinating. And you got complex characters. Nobody is a hero and nobody is a villain.

Funny, until recently, I didn’t know that this was actually based on a novel. And that’s rare for a Tarantino film. Maybe that’s why Jackie Brown feels different to me. 
Unfortunately, I haven’t read the novel so I don’t really know how close of an adaptation it is.

Nevertheless, I really like Jackie Brown and I think it’s one of those movies you can just watch it again and again and as you get older, you relate to it more and more.

Oh, and the movie is also got some pretty funny dialogue and one liners. I’ll leave you with a quote.

I guess using Modern Technology can be an emotional and uplifting experience.

That scene where Gollum is speaking to himself is not only distressing as he's having a severe mental breakdown against the two sides of his own conciousness, but also for the fact that CGI had come such a long way that it was able to carry such incredible emotions.

Since I knew nothing of le Carré's work or Smiley, and went into it blind, I wasn't sure most of the movie and before the reveal whether Smiley was the mole or not and playing everyone. He gives this smirk whenever key information is revealed and it's like he is amused how far people before him/catching upto him have come but it isn't going to matter since HE IS THE MOLE and they lost now.

While he was he narrating the story to Benedict Cumberbatch's character about meeting Karla for the first time, I was wondering the whole time whether he was bullshitting and giving a fake story. Maybe he IS the real Karla and the one in Russia is a ""fake one"" setup by him himself. Basically Usual Suspect-ing us. Also the way that shot was framed and filmed, it was like he was talking to himself(since I thought he IS karla) and the other chair was empty meaning There IS NO KARLA strong arming my suspision that he could be the mole. Also he doesn't remember the face of the now ""HEAD OF RUSSIA""? That was pretty sus to me. I guess he saw him too long time ago but he should atleast remember his important features.

I honestly don't know if it was intentional or not or if that was just how I was interpreting it. Was Smiley intentionally made to be a Red herring for newbies like me? I later learnt that Smiley is a famous character in the books and other media so for a newbie coming into this movie, were people like me also sus of smilie too? Or did a majority of the target audience knew he was a ""good"" guy beforehard and were never sus of him and were just focusing on the real mole between the 4 main candidates.

Also Benedict Cumberbatch's character, since I was so sus of Smiley, I felt was the perfect fall guy since he was doing most of the dirty work. I felt smiley was setting him up so he would die at somepoint and blame one of the 4 so Smiley will be free of any suspicious and keep on continue being the mole now being the head of the department.

And was the woman who was executed in front of Jim in the torture chamber, the same one Tom Hardy's character got the mole info from? That's pretty grim honestly. Doesn't he still think she is alive and they are going to trade her back?

All The deaths in this movies are just so brutal and bloody.

And at the end, Bill was going to be traded back to the Russians? But then Jim killed him because the betrayl was just too much? That would just fk up the deal that were going to do with the Russians. And Bill will get arrested. I suppose he had nothing left to loose. He is a true loner now. Drove the kid away too.

Honestly Pretty smart move planned by Karla to throw off Smiley by Bill seducing his wife.

I liked the Christmas scenes. Everyone was ""happy""

The ending montage was great with that french song.

One of my all-time favorite comfort movies.

Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti have incredible chemistry, and every viewing reveals something new that I didn’t notice before. I’ve honestly lost count at this point, but I’ve easily watched it ten times - maybe more. It never fails to make me laugh, think, and feel a little better about the chaos of life.

1otu6hr,The John Wick movies fails at the one thing thats important to the story,1aa96emlhc,Kutskin0,movies,0,0.14,54,1762818684.0,2025-11-11 00:51:24,True,"(slight spoilers but not about the story)

Which is that John is suppost to be incredibly good at what he does and he isn't. 
He finds himself in a situation he barely escapes from constantly while fighting random bad guy number 12#. Which is i guess good for tension but completely messes up the most important part of the character. Why would you make him out to be basically unstoppable and then put zero effort into actually showing it?

The action scenes are mindlessly choreographed (just trying to do cool shit) and filled with plot armour. And not just ""bad guy has stormtrooper aim"" plot armour but ridiculous stuff like when the two assasins let him live while fighting in the continental glass room. Why would you do this when trying to portray a character thats ""the best killer in the world""? 

The fightscenes couldve easily been used to demonstrate his high skill level. 
He couldve been hitting only headshots. Him out planning and killing random goons without breaking sweat instead of getting into a grappling match in every fight. The tension of the fight scenes shouldve have come from putting him in difficult situations and have him creatively get out of them but him clearly remaining superior.  
This couldve also helped create a contrast between the average henchman and the high level killers we see him go up against. In those scenes it would be appropriate to see him struggle. Currently theres no difference.

1otozkt,The Back to the Future Movies Would Be Lambasted by the Internet if They Came Out Today,vmwf7kg3,Kooky_Attention_850,movies,0,0.12,21,1762806481.0,2025-11-10 21:28:01,True,"These two movies are just so easy to nitpick. The first movie already have a few logistical problems concerning its time travel rules, but it at least stuck to its rules. The next two movies simply ignore those rules when it is convenient, and the characters make some really dumb choices:

BTTF Part II:

1. Marty does not need to time travel in order to fix his destiny, he just had to be warned by Brown.
2. Brown takes Jennifer to the future when it would have been easier to put her to sleep with that little device of his and take her home before leaving 1985.
3. Brown and Marty leave Jennifer lying on the street in 2015 when it would have been smarter to just leave her in the car. I mean, most people would just assume the DeLorean is Jennifer's or her husband's or anything of the sort, so no one would have gotten suspiscious of seeing Jennifer unconsciouss in the car.
4. When Marty was left in charge of looking over the time machine when Brown went to rescue Jennifer, Marty got distracted by a f\*cking dog for some reason, and he did not hear the time machine being turned on as it was being stolen by Biff for some other reason (Marty is an idiot, so we can maybe let this slide).
5. It is established in the first film that a rewrite of events that led to your existance in your relative past leads you to disappear from reality, but Marty and Brown do not disappear even if the past was changed, leading to the alternative 1985 and to the existence of alternate versions of themselves. A possible explanation would be that people do not just disappear automatically, it takes some time, but Future Biff did disappear from existence after he changed the past, and I also assume from the first film that people disappear sooner if they were born at a date closer to the change in the timeline, thus Marty and Brown should have disappeared before Biff.
6. After Biff changes the past, the timeline should immediately diverge, making it impossible for Old Biff to return to the same 2015 Marty and Brown are in. Biff should have returned to an alternate future where Trump Biff ruled everything, or not returned at all, yet he somehow makes it back and conveniently disappears offscreen.

BTTF Part III:

1. Marty and Brown meet and then just stay in Hill Valley, with the impending threat of Buford Tanner shooting Brown, when they could just leave.
2. That is all the nonsense here, or at least the major nonsense. Regardles, the film does have a few issues with the character of Clara. I have no idea why Brown just told Clara he was from the future without presenting any evidence, when the goddamn futuristic vehicle was RIGHT THERE! Oh, well, it is likely that Clara would not have believed him regardless, so I guess most people would let that slide. What I don't think people would stand is Clara's spernatural deduction abilities; she just looked at the model and guessed where Brown was. Also, a powerful finale to the saga that was in equal parts joyful and sad was butchered with super duper happy ending, with Brown just building a new time machine.

Do these problems ruin the movies for me? Not really, but I can definetly understand if they ruin the movies for someone else. All I'm saying is that film YouTubers would have a field day nitpicking these flicks and tearing them apart. I can see YouTube thumbnails saying stuff like ""Back to the Future - Part II: A Loveable Disaster"", or ""Why Clara Does Not Work"", etcetera. These two guys in particular would be the spokesmen of the BTTF sequel haters:

I love seeing talented young directors pay homage to the masters who came before them, as OG filmmakers once did for their own predecessors. It’s such a beautiful creative cycle, reimagining and reinterpreting visionary work through new eyes.

I spotted references to at least ten different horror classics throughout the film, something I’m sure fans of the genre can appreciate. Didn’t even recognize Amy Madigan in that clown makeup and the ‘It’ wig. Her performance is the best I’ve seen since Piper Laurie as Carrie’s mom.

I always admired in BTTF Part 3, how when Doc and Marty realized Clara was supposed to die in that cliff, Doc understands the nature of messing up the timeline and allowing someone who supposed to die, to live. So it makes sense taking her out of the timeline, since her disappearance doesn’t affect the timeline. This I always notice…… however my next discovery, I know how much we all love our ELB, our Doc in time….. however from 1985 perspective our “present” Doc dying in the original time is messing up the timeline. Original Marty never has a car, so he never gets into a car accident with Needles, doesn’t consider himself a worthless loser.

Had Doc never read that letter Marty left for him, Marty would have altered the timeline, come back, and Doc would have died, the “new” timeline, Marty would still have his new “perfect” life and would probably have mourned his friend and never gotten in that car accident.

To quote X-Men days of future past “time is like a river, you can throw a pebble and disrupt the current, but the current always corrects itself”

Time eventually gets Doc and Marty to 1955, where ONLY Doc get struck by a lightning bolt and stranded in 1885….. where he eventually DIES, however, while in 1885 Doc allows Clara to live, which creates a new ripple, so “time” gets Marty to see the grave, go BACK to 1885, and fix the Clara Ripple. 

Eventually I assume Doc realizes this and he and Clara become “Lost in Time” living their happily ever after.

Not sure if the writer went that deep into the story, but if they did….

one year in one world = ten years in another for example.

I think the film Authur and the Minimoys did this trope where years are counted by moon cycles. And it also counts the character ages differently compared to counting a human age.

Did I love the movie? No . But I liked it enough. I like how it ends. I like the little twists and turns and the tiny bits of hope. I like how the events are played out. What I don’t like is how Patrick being a total creep was overlooked and the fact that Mary ended up sending everyone’s files to them. Kind of crazy if you think about the damage it’ll probably cause to so many people . Also the lack of depth in Mary and Howard’s relationship which kind of confused me.
The thing I’d say I like most about the movie which isn’t apparent but just my interpretation of it ; is at the end Clem says Joel is eventually going to think all those bad things about her and she’s gonna get bored of him and he just says okay. To me it’s like yes that all could happen but he wants to experience all the good parts again even if it means it gets there. 
All in all the movie didn’t have an effect on me the way I thought it would.

In the past several years, my family has started a new Christmas tradition: a movie advent calendar centered around 1 actor. It started by watching a few too many Nicholas cage movies in a row. So many that we decided to just keep going with it up to Christmas.

In the years since, we pick a new actor and watch 25 of their movies, one on each day, until Christmas. Some have been better than others, so we’ve tried to lay out ground rules to make it the best possible advent calendar it can be. Nicholas Cage is the template. He was kind of perfect for this. The rules for the actor you choose are as follows:

- The chosen actor must have a wide variety of genres. With 25 movies to be watched, it can get dull if it’s just 25 action movies in a row, for example (They don’t have to be the main character, or even a supporting character, as long as they’re credited in a wide variety of movies).
- The chosen actor must have one Christmas movie to end with on December 25. This is allowed to be a “technically a Christmas movie” movie or a Christmas-adjacent movie. Just as long as it has Christmas in it.
- The chosen actor must be a scene-stealer. Enough charisma that you enjoy watching them whenever they’re on screen.
- Once again, Nicholas Cage was the template, so it helps if they’re a little bit wacky or have a distinct voice.

The rules were established after Harrison Ford didn’t have nearly enough wackiness or variety of genre to sustain the 25 days. Tom Hanks was a success, as was Bill Paxton.

I need your help to pick the actor we’ll watch the movies of this year. We’re having trouble deciding on one. Frankly, we’re having trouble coming up with ideas.

The first hour made me think it was going to be a happy-go-lucky movie. Then it got intense when they began having relationships issues all the way to the end. And I must say I love how real it is.
Personally I tend to like movies where the main characters don’t end up together as expected. I feel it’s a somewhat accurate representation of life. Sometimes, no matter how in love or perfect for each other two people are they don’t end up together for one reason or the other. And something about that is so touching and beautiful to me. Which I think is what is shown in this movie. I loved the ending.
Kind of makes me think around what happiness truly is. At the end they’re both happy having achieved their dreams but at the cost of each other. So are they truly happy or just satisfied. Do they regret any decisions they made in the past or hope things had gone differently so they’d be together even if it meant not achieving their goals.
I kind of felt stupid for being so emotional and tearing up at the end then I came on here and read a few reviews where people felt same so I felt way better.

Ross. Obiviously. The will they/won't they/recently slept together drama with ""Beth"" is an obvious lampoon of the Rachel-Ross dynamic.

Joey. He's the comedic relief and the goofy guy.

* **Elizabeth ""Beth"" McIntyre** (played by Odette Yustman/Annable): Rob's girlfriend who gets trapped in her apartment building during the attack.

Rachel. See ""Rob"".

* **Jason Hawkins** (played by Mike Vogel): Rob's brother.

Chandler. They mixed up the family dynamics to try and keep it more subtle but from what we see of Jason, he's sarcastic and awkward in a crisis.

* **Lily Ford** (played by Jessica Lucas): Jason's fiancée.

Monica. Shacked up with Ross/Rob's sister/brother. Neurotic and super-serious.

1osq2mf,Movie Math: Se7en + Inception = The Cell (2000),fvqyz,MTRIFE,movies,0,0.4,13,1762711350.0,2025-11-09 19:02:30,True,"Hear me out. The Cell (2000) is what you would get if you combined the grimy procedural nihilism of Se7en with the mind bending dreamscapes of Inception.

You’ve got the same serial [killer framework that made Se7en what it was. A ritualistic murderer, an emotionally wrecked detective, and a descent into the psychology of evil. But instead of what's in the box, you get the concept of Inception taken to its grotesque extreme: literally entering the killer’s subconscious through dream tech.

Visually, Tarsem Singh treats the killer’s mind like Nolan treats dreams. Surreal logic, symbolic architecture, and warped perception. Jennifer Lopez plays the Cobb character diving into layers of a mental reality, but instead of planting an idea, she’s trying to rescue a victim and make sense of a fractured psyche.

It’s not as airtight or polished as either Se7en or Inception obviously, but thematically it bridges them. The Cell asks the same moral question Fincher posed  which is if empathy can reach evil? Then it's wrapped in the visual spectacle and psychological exploration that Nolan later perfected.

TL;DR: Se7en is the mind of the killer; Inception is the architecture of the mind; The Cell is both put together. A detective thriller trapped inside a nightmare painting.

In my opinion he has no “bad” movies and I consider all of his work bar Tenet an 8+ out of 10, I gave Tenet a 7.5 (bare in mind I haven’t had the chance to see Insomnia or Following)

However whenever I seem to mention my love for Nolan on Reddit I’m always met with a similar response of a collective eye roll from responders. I do understand that he’s the popular pick for people who aren’t that into cinema and just watch blockbusters, but I also think it’s for a reason as well.

I do understand that Nolan often tries to appeal to mass audiences, thus alienating a bunch of movie lovers who prefer smaller, more intimate, more individualistic cinema. And that’s a critique I consider to be valid. It does boil down to preference.

I just wanted to ask you guys what your personal opinions are on Christopher Nolan, maybe I’ll gain a new perspective from this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ot0hx8/what_is_your_personal_opinion_on_christopher_nolan/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ot0hx8/what_is_your_personal_opinion_on_christopher_nolan/,Discussion,False,False,False,False,2025-11-10,2,Monday

At one point she is training him, but he’s injured, and so to save time she just shoots him to reset the day and start again. That’s fine, apart from… what will happen to her the moment he dies?

Will everything immediately reset, effectively meaning instant ‘death’ for that version of her, given that she won’t remember any of this? In which case it’s the same as if she had put the gun to her own head and pulled the trigger. Or will her universe carry on, in which case presumably she is arrested and locked up for shooting a man in the head (unless she can get out of it somehow) and then she has to wait for death when the Mimics overcome everyone?

If it’s the former, then fact that they’re going to ‘try again’ means absolutely nothing to her, in a way!

So I’m watching Weapons, which is probably my favorite movie of the year, and I’m at the scene where Archer is having his dream sequence, and it comes to the part with the AK47 over the house with 217 on it, and already the movie has me thinking about that number since it’s the time that all the kids went missing. And in this scene Archer is looking for his son Matthew, so I keep hearing the name Matthew spoken. So I pause the movie and do a quick google search of “Matthew 2:17” and get this:

Matthew 2:17 states, ""Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet"". This verse, followed by Matthew 2:18, connects the tragic massacre of the male children in Bethlehem by King Herod to the prophecy in Jeremiah 31:15, which describes a voice in Ramah: ""lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not"". This connection is used to show that Jesus was the promised Messiah and to highlight the sorrow and evil surrounding his birth. 

Since watching the film I’ve seen a number of theorys of meanings behind different aspects of the film and specifically the significance of the number 217, which Zack Cregger says himself is really just an homage to the shining, but haven’t seen anyone say anything about the Bible passage. Which would make this seem coincidental, but if it is purely coincidental, that is an awfully crazy coincidence considering how close to the theme of the movie that bible passage is. Thoughts?

The other day I rewatched the Matrix Reloaded and I was like this has better effects than modern movies. To me the CGI scenes were bad but still gets by when compared to what's acceptable today. The green filter made me think something was wrong wtih my TV at first too lol.

 But the action omg, they had 10 minute battles! (btw that movie is one of my fav movies for the action. I know people hate it for the Superpman complex but i feel they focused a lot on other characters to get around that and had neo fall for what harms goku, which are tricks hehe.)

Trying to find that in Modern movies just feels sad. The movies have some action but it's a mostly unrealistic cartoon mess of CGI(like the hulk meme thing lol). A 2000 film outdoes it, though, we do sometimes get John Wick and Nobody1(skip the second one not sure what happened!),  which apparently the stunt person from the Matrix helped on. 

I guess there are of course a few exceptions. Probably the best fights I've seen recently has been Daredevil, though, more of a mini series. The fights were sort of like real time and lasted a while. Really well done imo. 

Another  recent one has been the Raid, though, not a USA film. I do think maybe things were maybe just a bit oversold with the fights but it still was great over all imo.

There are fighting movies made too but idk most  that i try just feel too sporty. Need the rocky or Anime drama for them to work hehe

 The big thing now are Sueperheros. You have Superheros and a 2000 film that had issues out does it all by a mile.  The Snyder cut had really good action scenes, especially when the Wolf invaded the Amazon island or Superman went rogue, Logan omg. But hoenstly Most of the time in the average the action is very short and you hardly see the enviroment used. 

I'm just wondering why action is a bad thing in modern films is all. I guess some movies they try to put plot in and tbh it sucks. Like the marvel filks it's mostly a 30 second action scene to build things up and then it's a lot of table talk and political meetings lol. I just idk can't accept the Matrix Reloaded being one of the best in terms of action and modern effects in terms action/fighting. Like why do you think they avoid fighting action movies now anyways?

I actually quite enjoy this film and I am very impressed with how Coppola made the film. In my opinion, it is a flawed masterpiece and I am amazed with the Costume Designs, Set Designs, and The Special Effects. With the Special Effects, apparently, Coppola hired a visual effects teams, but when they told him what they wanted for practical effects was impossible, Coppola disagreed and fired them and replaced them with his son Roman Coppola, As a result, all of the visual effects seen in the film were achieved without the use of optical or computer-generated effects, instead using con-set and in-camera methods. I kind have respect Coppola for that, given how the special effects played out

With the performances, Gary Oldman is great as Dracula, a power monster, but a tragic figure who longs to reunite with his lost love. I know Keanu Reeves get a lot of flack for his accent, and yes its terrible, but I also feel Winona Ryder wasn’t good with her accent either. I also think what doesn’t help him is the fact that Cary Elwes is right in front of you and actually would have made a better Jonathan Harker. But I do think Keanu was good as Jon Harker, but Gary Oldman really outclasses him. Winona Ryder and Anthony Hopkins are good in their roles as Mina Harker and Van Helsing and Tom Watts is a scene stealer as Reinfeld.

In my opinion, Bram Stoker’s Dracula has great visuals, and set designs and good performances, but also there are a few mid performances, and the screenplay was a bit lackluster, but it was an enjoyable experience and regardless, I do like the film.",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ordw7l/thoughts_on_bram_stokers_dracula/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ordw7l/thoughts_on_bram_stokers_dracula/,Discussion,False,False,False,False,2025-11-08,3,Saturday

1or8alu,I was wrong about Halloween (1978).  It's perfect.,egrgp,y2justdog,movies,58,0.74,23,1762554363.0,2025-11-07 23:26:03,True,"I've probably seen this movie four or five times over the years, as a teenager, in my twenties, in my thirties, but I never was fully immersed in it because of various circumstances, whether it was watching it with a friend, watching it on low volume, distractions, etc.  However, I watched it yesterday in the dark on my laptop with my ear buds in, and it was tremendous.  What a perfect slasher.  First of all, there is no fat in this movie.  It jumps right into the darkness, with Loomis driving with the psychiatric hospital nurse, stumbling upon the patients walking around outside in the dark.  The atmosphere is eerie and unsettling.  I never realized how much heavy mask breathing from Myers stalking perspective there was.  It was super creepy.  You've got Laurie just trying to go about her day babysitting on Halloween night and the movie has a nice slow burn to it building up to a boil as Myers inches closer.  The cinematography is great.  There are countless iconic scenes.  Now I need to re-watch part two and see how it holds up.  Is the original Halloween still your favorite in the franchise?",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1or8alu/i_was_wrong_about_halloween_1978_its_perfect/,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1or8alu/i_was_wrong_about_halloween_1978_its_perfect/,Discussion,False,False,False,False,2025-11-07,23,Friday

Smooth, very stylized, camera work can contribute to humor, etc. The story can definitely be non linear, as I love that “ooohhh!” realization moment at the end or so. As I previously stated some humor wouldnt hurt at all. I want to be hooked, I want to enjoy my experience and be entertained. Any recommendations?
